1
00:00:00,433 --> 00:00:01,966
Today we're going to talk about a country that

2
00:00:01,966 --> 00:00:03,733
can be considered one of the biggest economic disasters in modern human history:

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:06,533
Venezuela.

4
00:00:08,133 --> 00:00:09,666
As the country with the world's largest oil reserves, it started with a hand of

5
00:00:10,899 --> 00:00:11,799
"two kings and four twos,"

6
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,200
yet its GDP plummeted by 80% in less than a decade.

7
00:00:15,899 --> 00:00:16,833
According to UN estimates, by

8
00:00:16,833 --> 00:00:18,566
2024, 82% of the population will

9
00:00:18,566 --> 00:00:19,866
live below the poverty line. The

10
00:00:19,866 --> 00:00:22,066
capital, Caracas, has an entire mountain of slums, and it boasts one of the

11
00:00:22,066 --> 00:00:23,466
highest murder rates in the world.

12
00:00:24,666 --> 00:00:26,733
In this country where gas is practically free,

13
00:00:26,733 --> 00:00:28,233
even basic necessities like toilet paper, food, and medicine are in

14
00:00:28,233 --> 00:00:30,066
extreme shortage.

15
00:00:30,066 --> 00:00:31,799
Supermarkets are so crowded that you have to be queuing to buy groceries, checking the

16
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:32,866
last digit of your ID card, and they

17
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:35,033
have very strict armed security. For over a

18
00:00:35,033 --> 00:00:37,366
decade, Venezuela has been mired in hyperinflation, where

19
00:00:37,366 --> 00:00:38,600
money is weighed by the pound. The

20
00:00:41,199 --> 00:00:42,133
rate of currency devaluation is

21
00:00:42,133 --> 00:00:43,066
outrageous!

22
00:00:43,066 --> 00:00:44,199
If you stacked 100-bolivar bills from 20 years ago one by

23
00:00:45,466 --> 00:00:46,466
one and

24
00:00:46,466 --> 00:00:48,499
physically filled the entire Bird's Nest stadium—

25
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:49,333
or even

26
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:50,533
40 Bird's Nest stadiums—how much would that be

27
00:00:50,533 --> 00:00:52,133
worth? It's only enough to

28
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:53,999
buy a McDonald's hamburger, and

29
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,366
you can't even get fries and a soda,

30
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:02,666
etc.—these are some of the most horrific concepts.  It

31
00:01:02,666 --> 00:01:04,966
turns out that all these factors have manifested in this one country.

32
00:01:04,966 --> 00:01:05,766
So don't think

33
00:01:05,766 --> 00:01:06,799
we're talking about Venezuela today just

34
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,166
because it's a political hotspot.

35
00:01:08,166 --> 00:01:09,066
Let's take a look at

36
00:01:09,066 --> 00:01:11,333
how it managed to turn such a promising situation into this.

37
00:01:17,966 --> 00:01:18,499
Venezuela

38
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,400
is a country on the northern coast of South America, with a

39
00:01:20,399 --> 00:01:22,666
land area of ​​approximately 910,000 square kilometers, slightly

40
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:24,300
larger than the three northeastern provinces of China combined. It

41
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,100
currently has a population of about 28 million. Originally, the population was

42
00:01:27,533 --> 00:01:29,600
mainly composed of indigenous Indians.

43
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,533
From the 16th century onwards, it was

44
00:01:30,533 --> 00:01:32,700
ruled by the Spanish for nearly 300 years,

45
00:01:32,699 --> 00:01:33,899
so it still speaks Spanish.

46
00:01:33,899 --> 00:01:35,533
It gained independence in 1830, becoming one of the first countries in

47
00:01:35,533 --> 00:01:37,700
South America to break free from Spanish rule. However, the

48
00:01:38,933 --> 00:01:41,033
key factor that truly influenced its development wasn't

49
00:01:41,033 --> 00:01:42,500
independence or

50
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,266
colonization,

51
00:01:43,266 --> 00:01:44,699
but something else entirely. In

52
00:01:47,533 --> 00:01:48,466
1914,

53
00:01:48,466 --> 00:01:50,799
Venezuela drilled its first commercial oil well and

54
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,533
discovered oil.

55
00:01:51,533 --> 00:01:52,800
In the following 21 years,

56
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,266
it transformed from an unknown country

57
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:56,899
into the world's second-largest oil producer, second

58
00:01:56,899 --> 00:01:57,599
only to the United States.

59
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,900
We often say that oil is black gold.

60
00:01:58,899 --> 00:02:00,299
This windfall made

61
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,066
Venezuela's then-dictator,

62
00:02:02,066 --> 00:02:02,633
Gómez, the

63
00:02:02,633 --> 00:02:04,533
richest man in all of Latin America.  In

64
00:02:05,133 --> 00:02:06,499
our previous episode on oil, we discussed how, in the

65
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,300
early days, global oil resources were

66
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,600
monopolized by seven British and American oil companies,

67
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,066
known as the "Seven Sisters,"

68
00:02:12,066 --> 00:02:13,099
forming a cartel.

69
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,333
Venezuela's share was distributed among

70
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:15,199
three of these:

71
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:15,999
Gulf Oil,

72
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,800
Standard Oil,

73
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,800
and Shell.

74
00:02:18,733 --> 00:02:19,433
Initially,

75
00:02:19,433 --> 00:02:20,833
these three had considerable influence,

76
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:23,533
as the technology for extracting and transporting oil was relatively scarce.

77
00:02:23,533 --> 00:02:24,433
Venezuela,

78
00:02:24,433 --> 00:02:26,133
being a small, inland country,

79
00:02:26,133 --> 00:02:27,733
could only receive a small share of the oil profits.

80
00:02:27,733 --> 00:02:28,833
However, after World War II,

81
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:29,599
these oil-producing nations

82
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,900
began to realize something was

83
00:02:30,899 --> 00:02:31,666
amiss. "

84
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:33,100
So many companies can extract oil,

85
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,200
but only I possess

86
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:34,899
this resource. This is the

87
00:02:34,899 --> 00:02:36,533
scarcest and most valuable resource.

88
00:02:36,533 --> 00:02:37,666
I am the rightful owner!

89
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:37,700
What are you Seven Sisters doing, acting so arrogantly?"

90
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:38,866
Thus,

91
00:02:38,866 --> 00:02:40,933
Venezuela rallied other Middle Eastern oil-producing nations to

92
00:02:40,933 --> 00:02:42,333
negotiate with the Seven Sisters,

93
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:44,499
signing the famous 50/50 revenue-sharing agreement.

94
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,300
Simply put, "

95
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,533
I let you extract oil here, and we'll split the profits 50/50."

96
00:02:48,066 --> 00:02:49,866
Later, Venezuela, along with four other Middle Eastern countries,

97
00:02:49,866 --> 00:02:51,866
established OPEC.

98
00:02:52,066 --> 00:02:53,733
This significantly boosted Venezuela's government revenue, making

99
00:02:54,733 --> 00:02:56,266
its goldmine even larger.  In

100
00:02:56,266 --> 00:02:57,199
just five years,

101
00:02:57,199 --> 00:02:58,566
government revenue increased sixfold.

102
00:02:58,566 --> 00:02:59,833
But the real golden age was yet to

103
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:00,966
come; the

104
00:03:00,966 --> 00:03:01,899
previous wealth was

105
00:03:01,899 --> 00:03:03,199
merely a drop in the ocean. In

106
00:03:03,966 --> 00:03:05,733
1973, the Yom Kippur War broke out,

107
00:03:05,733 --> 00:03:07,766
also known as the "Fourth Middle East War."

108
00:03:07,766 --> 00:03:09,333
Arab countries in the Middle East joined forces to

109
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:10,966
impose an oil embargo on the West,

110
00:03:10,966 --> 00:03:12,099
plunging the world into an oil shortage. Oil

111
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,600
prices quadrupled in a short period,

112
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,200
from $3 to $12 per barrel—the

113
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:16,966
first oil crisis. A

114
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,266
few years later, in 1979, the

115
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:20,766
second oil crisis erupted, with

116
00:03:20,766 --> 00:03:23,366
oil prices soaring to $35 per barrel—ten times higher than

117
00:03:23,366 --> 00:03:24,566
ten years earlier! This

118
00:03:24,566 --> 00:03:26,866
led to global inflation and

119
00:03:26,866 --> 00:03:27,666
economic stagnation.

120
00:03:28,399 --> 00:03:29,866
But for Venezuela, it was a

121
00:03:29,866 --> 00:03:31,533
windfall—a

122
00:03:31,533 --> 00:03:32,866
huge windfall! Venezuela was likely the biggest beneficiary of

123
00:03:32,866 --> 00:03:34,066
these two consecutive oil crises.

124
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,533
It's an oil-exporting country, has

125
00:03:37,533 --> 00:03:38,766
little connection to the Middle East, and is very close

126
00:03:38,766 --> 00:03:39,899
to the United States. Furthermore, in

127
00:03:39,899 --> 00:03:41,566
1976, the Venezuelan government

128
00:03:41,566 --> 00:03:43,366
fully nationalized its oil industry,

129
00:03:43,366 --> 00:03:45,866
establishing its own state-owned oil company, PDVSA.

130
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:47,899
If the previous oil prices

131
00:03:47,899 --> 00:03:49,433
were a gold mine for it,

132
00:03:49,433 --> 00:03:50,533
this one was a...  In a

133
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:53,966
mere 10 years,

134
00:03:53,966 --> 00:03:55,499
Venezuela's GDP increased sixfold.

135
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,333
The capital, Caracas,

136
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:58,166
saw the construction of South America's most modern highways,

137
00:03:58,166 --> 00:03:59,500
skyscrapers, and university towns. State-owned

138
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,433
enterprises

139
00:04:00,433 --> 00:04:01,933
expanded rapidly, employing 300,000 people. Waiters were everywhere – in

140
00:04:03,633 --> 00:04:04,399
elevators,

141
00:04:04,399 --> 00:04:05,166
public bathrooms,

142
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:05,966
office doors – a

143
00:04:07,766 --> 00:04:09,166
single job. The

144
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:10,133
government had plenty of money. Meanwhile,

145
00:04:10,133 --> 00:04:12,199
private enterprises shrank further.

146
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:12,966
But that didn't matter;

147
00:04:12,966 --> 00:04:14,233
even if large companies weren't profitable,

148
00:04:14,233 --> 00:04:15,933
government subsidies sustained them. The

149
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,633
Venezuelan bolivar

150
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:20,366
became one of the world's strongest currencies

151
00:04:20,366 --> 00:04:21,633
due to its extremely strong exchange rate.

152
00:04:21,633 --> 00:04:22,799
At the time, Venezuela's middle class

153
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,366
would even travel to Miami on weekends to shop. As long as

154
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,833
oil prices remained high, the

155
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:29,799
Venezuelan government had a continuous supply of resources.

156
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,166
As long as oil prices remained high,

157
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:32,700
every citizen could relax and

158
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:34,533
enjoy high wages and welfare.

159
00:04:34,533 --> 00:04:35,833
As long as oil prices remained high, there was

160
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:37,133
enough incentive to keep the

161
00:04:37,133 --> 00:04:39,299
entire economy at the top of the world.

162
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,933
No economic problem seemed insignificant. However, this golden age didn't last. In the

163
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:47,233
1980s, international oil prices began to plummet. Initially, the

164
00:04:47,233 --> 00:04:49,133
Venezuelan government hoped

165
00:04:49,133 --> 00:04:50,533
this was just a temporary setback,

166
00:04:50,533 --> 00:04:52,366
so although government revenue began to decline...

167
00:04:53,233 --> 00:04:54,766
Instead of cutting back on redundant government spending, Venezuela

168
00:04:54,766 --> 00:04:56,199
opted for massive debt issuance,

169
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:57,699
hoping that a rise in oil prices would allow it to recover quickly.

170
00:05:01,366 --> 00:05:03,366
However, this was naive;

171
00:05:03,366 --> 00:05:04,766
it was merely the beginning of a nightmare.

172
00:05:04,766 --> 00:05:05,766
To combat high inflation,

173
00:05:05,766 --> 00:05:07,166
the US announced interest rate hikes, and

174
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:08,566
capital began to flee Latin American markets. In

175
00:05:08,566 --> 00:05:10,633
1982, Mexico couldn't hold on any longer and

176
00:05:10,633 --> 00:05:12,166
declared it unable to repay its foreign debt,

177
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:13,900
officially triggering the Latin American debt crisis.

178
00:05:13,899 --> 00:05:15,633
Venezuela was also severely affected. On

179
00:05:16,466 --> 00:05:17,699
February 18, 1983,

180
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:18,399
the president announced a devaluation

181
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:19,166
of the bolivar

182
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:20,900
from 4.3

183
00:05:20,899 --> 00:05:22,233
to 7.5 US dollars

184
00:05:22,233 --> 00:05:23,566
and implemented foreign exchange controls.

185
00:05:23,566 --> 00:05:25,599
Given that Venezuela relied heavily on imports, the price of almost everything

186
00:05:26,633 --> 00:05:27,699
it bought

187
00:05:27,699 --> 00:05:28,799
nearly doubled in an instant.

188
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:29,899
This day

189
00:05:29,899 --> 00:05:31,466
became known as Venezuela's

190
00:05:31,466 --> 00:05:32,433
"Black Friday."

191
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,266
Venezuela quickly plunged into an economic crisis,

192
00:05:35,266 --> 00:05:37,466
and oil prices further collapsed in 1986,

193
00:05:37,466 --> 00:05:39,833
plummeting from $27 to less than $10.

194
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:41,533
What Venezuela never expected was that

195
00:05:41,533 --> 00:05:42,933
oil prices would fall from this low level...  After

196
00:05:42,933 --> 00:05:44,800
nearly 20 years of continuous turmoil,

197
00:05:46,133 --> 00:05:47,933
Venezuela's inflation began to rise.

198
00:05:47,933 --> 00:05:50,233
The government tried price controls and foreign exchange controls,

199
00:05:50,233 --> 00:05:51,000
but they were ineffective.

200
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,433
Corruption was too rampant, and

201
00:05:52,433 --> 00:05:54,433
many policies simply could not be effectively implemented.

202
00:05:54,966 --> 00:05:57,566
Moreover, many of these policies were counterproductive,

203
00:05:57,566 --> 00:05:59,433
further pushing up prices in Venezuela.

204
00:06:01,133 --> 00:06:02,366
We will analyze this in more detail when the situation worsens.

205
00:06:03,566 --> 00:06:05,666
The government realized that various control policies were not working, and

206
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:07,833
in 1989, a new president

207
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:08,666
named Perez was elected. He

208
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:10,066
went to the other extreme,

209
00:06:10,933 --> 00:06:11,800
completely deregulating the market. Foreign

210
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,533
exchange, interest rates, and prices were allowed to

211
00:06:13,533 --> 00:06:14,933
fluctuate as they pleased.

212
00:06:14,933 --> 00:06:15,933
The government stopped subsidies, and state-owned

213
00:06:15,933 --> 00:06:17,166
enterprises were privatized.

214
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:19,833
This period is also known as the "Great Adjustment Period." Those who

215
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:22,866
frequently read our content should be familiar with this kind of

216
00:06:24,866 --> 00:06:26,566
extreme market liberalization ideology, which was extremely popular in the 1990s,

217
00:06:26,566 --> 00:06:27,599
mainly promoted by the United States.

218
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,533
At that time, it wasn't just in Latin America, but also in

219
00:06:28,533 --> 00:06:29,600
Southeast Asia,

220
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,533
and later in Russia and Poland with shock therapy.

221
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,800
It believed that the market could solve all problems on its own.

222
00:06:34,966 --> 00:06:37,399
From an economic theory perspective,

223
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:38,766
market-oriented and liberalized reforms are

224
00:06:38,766 --> 00:06:39,633
not inherently problematic. The

225
00:06:39,633 --> 00:06:40,899
problem is that these policies were a bit

226
00:06:40,899 --> 00:06:41,933
too radical.  The

227
00:06:41,933 --> 00:06:43,333
sudden abandonment of all control had a

228
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:45,299
devastating short-term impact on the economy.

229
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,233
More importantly,

230
00:06:46,233 --> 00:06:47,400
this laissez-faire approach to market competition

231
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:48,366
has a prerequisite: a

232
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:50,766
basic business environment and a sound

233
00:06:50,766 --> 00:06:51,799
legal framework. But

234
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,033
what was Venezuela's situation at the time?

235
00:06:53,033 --> 00:06:54,333
Market rules were vague,

236
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:55,366
regulation was virtually nonexistent,

237
00:06:55,366 --> 00:06:56,600
many laws were ineffective,

238
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,166
and then the government suddenly stopped intervening.

239
00:06:58,166 --> 00:07:00,366
Food price subsidies, energy subsidies, and the

240
00:07:00,366 --> 00:07:01,466
minimum wage all disappeared.

241
00:07:01,466 --> 00:07:03,233
This inevitably worsened the domestic economy, leading to

242
00:07:03,233 --> 00:07:05,400
numerous protests and riots. The

243
00:07:06,633 --> 00:07:08,366
bolivar began to plummet. As

244
00:07:08,366 --> 00:07:10,266
we just mentioned, on Black Friday in 1983,

245
00:07:10,266 --> 00:07:12,166
one dollar was worth 7.5 bolivars;

246
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:12,966
by 1993, it

247
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:15,066
had fallen to 100 bolivars. In

248
00:07:16,033 --> 00:07:16,833
1994, a

249
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:18,466
major banking crisis occurred, with more than half of the banks,

250
00:07:18,466 --> 00:07:20,066
including its second-largest,

251
00:07:20,066 --> 00:07:21,533
collapsing. The

252
00:07:21,533 --> 00:07:23,466
corruption within the government and financial sector was

253
00:07:23,466 --> 00:07:25,533
now fully exposed.

254
00:07:25,533 --> 00:07:26,433
President Perez,

255
00:07:26,433 --> 00:07:27,800
for embezzling 250 million bolivars from the National Liberty Fund,

256
00:07:28,933 --> 00:07:31,000
became the first president to be impeached by the Supreme Court. The

257
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,399
Finance Minister was also forced to resign.

258
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:35,266
This marked the complete failure of the "Great Adjustment" era.  When

259
00:07:36,466 --> 00:07:37,633
the tide went out,

260
00:07:37,633 --> 00:07:38,966
everyone suddenly realized that

261
00:07:38,966 --> 00:07:40,633
almost everyone was swimming naked.

262
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:44,433
This financial crisis, which

263
00:07:44,433 --> 00:07:46,000
many people might have glossed over,

264
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,766
actually had a more direct

265
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:48,799
impact on Venezuela's economy

266
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,833
than the problems we just discussed. It was like a

267
00:07:52,366 --> 00:07:54,200
heavy punch to Venezuela's jaw, causing it to collapse instantly.

268
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,766
Speaking of which,

269
00:07:56,766 --> 00:07:58,566
I guess you've probably sensed from our conversation that

270
00:07:59,533 --> 00:08:01,633
Venezuelan politics is quite chaotic. Just

271
00:08:01,633 --> 00:08:03,366
look at how frequently its name has changed.

272
00:08:03,966 --> 00:08:05,966
When it gained independence in 1830, it was

273
00:08:05,966 --> 00:08:07,233
called the

274
00:08:07,233 --> 00:08:08,666
States of Venezuela.

275
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:09,866
Later, it was renamed the Republic

276
00:08:09,866 --> 00:08:11,966
of Venezuela.

277
00:08:11,966 --> 00:08:12,866
Less than ten years

278
00:08:12,866 --> 00:08:14,333
later, seeing the Americans to the north with a better

279
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:15,033
system, they

280
00:08:15,033 --> 00:08:15,733
fought a war and

281
00:08:15,733 --> 00:08:17,433
changed the name to the

282
00:08:17,433 --> 00:08:18,966
United States of Venezuela.

283
00:08:18,966 --> 00:08:20,266
Then, after World War II, it changed back to the

284
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:21,466
Republic of Venezuela. And

285
00:08:21,466 --> 00:08:22,000
then, you see, it

286
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,799
has to change again.

287
00:08:23,633 --> 00:08:25,799
Although its system has been basically democratic elections, these

288
00:08:25,799 --> 00:08:26,633
elections are

289
00:08:26,633 --> 00:08:28,466
often invalid or heavily manipulated. There

290
00:08:29,433 --> 00:08:30,999
are also many different forces vying for power within the government,

291
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,333
so every president's

292
00:08:33,066 --> 00:08:34,133
position is far from secure.  They

293
00:08:34,133 --> 00:08:36,399
have to balance the interests of various interest groups, constantly worry about being

294
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,999
overthrown in a coup,

295
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,933
attract votes, and of

296
00:08:40,933 --> 00:08:42,966
course, gain personal benefits.

297
00:08:42,966 --> 00:08:44,366
This inevitably leads to many problems.

298
00:08:44,366 --> 00:08:45,800
But I believe that in the long run,

299
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:46,999
a fundamental problem

300
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,566
is that its leadership is incapable of long-term investment and

301
00:08:49,566 --> 00:08:51,000
long-term planning. Let me give you

302
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,266
a simple example: do you think

303
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:54,399
Venezuelan leaders

304
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,466
don't understand that oil prices will fluctuate and

305
00:08:56,466 --> 00:08:57,433
won't rise forever? The

306
00:08:57,433 --> 00:08:58,799
simplest way to prevent this is to

307
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,566
establish a national fund, like Norway, to save money

308
00:09:00,566 --> 00:09:01,733
when oil prices are high and buy

309
00:09:02,533 --> 00:09:03,466
gold or

310
00:09:03,466 --> 00:09:04,400
foreign bonds—is that

311
00:09:05,466 --> 00:09:06,366
so difficult? Didn't the

312
00:09:06,366 --> 00:09:08,266
Venezuelan government think of this?

313
00:09:08,299 --> 00:09:09,533
Actually, it's not that they haven't tried,

314
00:09:09,533 --> 00:09:11,066
but these presidents gradually realized that

315
00:09:11,066 --> 00:09:12,566
every time they tried to save money, it only

316
00:09:12,566 --> 00:09:15,633
became a cash cow for the next few presidents. The

317
00:09:15,633 --> 00:09:17,066
dramatic changes in power, coupled

318
00:09:17,066 --> 00:09:18,166
with rampant corruption, made

319
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:19,466
any long-term investment

320
00:09:19,466 --> 00:09:20,766
almost impossible. Note that

321
00:09:20,766 --> 00:09:22,433
I'm referring to long-term investment

322
00:09:22,433 --> 00:09:24,166
not only investments with returns, but

323
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:25,599
also institutional investments,

324
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,733
such as investing in anti-corruption

325
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:29,033
efforts and establishing transparent and fair mechanisms.

326
00:09:29,033 --> 00:09:30,833
This is very difficult in Venezuela,

327
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:33,266
so generally, successive presidents...  The most direct and

328
00:09:33,266 --> 00:09:34,499
effective policy he could implement was

329
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,333
subsidies.

330
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:37,566
This kind of short-term, quick-return approach

331
00:09:37,566 --> 00:09:38,766
garnered public support.

332
00:09:38,766 --> 00:09:39,933
From this perspective,

333
00:09:39,933 --> 00:09:40,733
look at the Middle East—

334
00:09:40,733 --> 00:09:42,133
Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the UAE—these

335
00:09:42,133 --> 00:09:43,966
are centralized monarchies.

336
00:09:43,966 --> 00:09:45,833
While they have many problems stemming from their power,

337
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:47,933
they can indeed take a longer-term view and

338
00:09:47,933 --> 00:09:49,266
make many long-term investments.

339
00:09:49,266 --> 00:09:50,799
After all, this isn't just for the country, but also

340
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:52,066
for their own future

341
00:09:52,066 --> 00:09:53,133
and their descendants.

342
00:09:53,133 --> 00:09:54,866
Look at their visionary plans, right? They

343
00:09:54,866 --> 00:09:57,000
might even be a bit too willing to invest long-term. In short,

344
00:09:57,133 --> 00:09:59,133
Venezuelan politics is quite chaotic. Let's go back to the

345
00:09:59,133 --> 00:10:00,433
timeline. In the

346
00:10:02,133 --> 00:10:03,666
1980s and 1990s, with

347
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:04,999
low oil prices,

348
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Venezuela's GDP

349
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,033
didn't grow for 15 years. The

350
00:10:07,033 --> 00:10:08,799
economy stagnated, struggling with

351
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:10,133
high inflation.

352
00:10:10,133 --> 00:10:11,366
The people increasingly hoped for

353
00:10:11,366 --> 00:10:13,433
a major reform. Against

354
00:10:14,133 --> 00:10:15,266
this historical backdrop, in

355
00:10:15,266 --> 00:10:16,233
1999,

356
00:10:16,233 --> 00:10:17,866
Venezuela's most famous president

357
00:10:17,866 --> 00:10:20,066
and most controversial leader came to power:

358
00:10:20,066 --> 00:10:21,933
Hugo Chávez.

359
00:10:24,733 --> 00:10:26,333
Chávez himself had a military background and led

360
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:27,433
a very authoritarian government.

361
00:10:27,433 --> 00:10:30,133
He advocated so-called "21st-century socialism," which

362
00:10:30,133 --> 00:10:31,133
later became...  The

363
00:10:31,133 --> 00:10:32,966
"United Socialist Party of Venezuela" had

364
00:10:35,433 --> 00:10:36,833
very close ties with Cuba and a

365
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:38,066
very close relationship with Castro.

366
00:10:38,066 --> 00:10:39,533
On several occasions,

367
00:10:39,533 --> 00:10:41,566
he would fly over to celebrate Castro's birthday with him for several days.

368
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:46,133
In fact, Chavez

369
00:10:46,133 --> 00:10:47,633
had attempted to overthrow the existing regime in 1992,

370
00:10:47,633 --> 00:10:48,433
though unsuccessfully,

371
00:10:48,433 --> 00:10:50,066
but he gained significant public support.

372
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:51,400
Later, in the 1997 election,

373
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:53,433
he advocated for large-scale reforms to

374
00:10:53,433 --> 00:10:54,133
change the status quo and

375
00:10:54,133 --> 00:10:54,966
eliminate corruption.

376
00:10:54,966 --> 00:10:56,600
Imagine, the people, utterly disillusioned with the corrupt government,

377
00:10:57,566 --> 00:10:59,366
certainly hoped for a strong leader

378
00:10:59,366 --> 00:11:00,233
to change the status quo.

379
00:11:00,233 --> 00:11:02,266
Thus, Chavez came to power forcefully and remained president of Venezuela

380
00:11:02,266 --> 00:11:04,066
until his death from cancer in 2013. What did

381
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:07,766
Chavez do

382
00:11:07,766 --> 00:11:08,966
first upon taking office? He

383
00:11:08,966 --> 00:11:10,166
changed the country's name

384
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:11,366
from "Republic of Venezuela" to

385
00:11:11,366 --> 00:11:13,633
"Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela."

386
00:11:13,633 --> 00:11:15,566
He said he would carry out a thorough reform,

387
00:11:15,566 --> 00:11:17,366
calling it the "Bolivarian Revolution."

388
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:19,566
You see, they seem to really like "Bolivarian," right? It's the

389
00:11:19,566 --> 00:11:20,266
country's name, and even the

390
00:11:20,266 --> 00:11:20,999
currency. The

391
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Bolivar is

392
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,533
actually a name associated with a great general who

393
00:11:23,533 --> 00:11:24,466
helped South America gain independence

394
00:11:24,466 --> 00:11:25,533
from Spanish rule in the 19th century,

395
00:11:27,633 --> 00:11:29,399
so he has a symbolic meaning of independence and

396
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:30,533
patriotism.

397
00:11:30,533 --> 00:11:31,433
Chávez believed that

398
00:11:31,433 --> 00:11:33,133
Venezuela's previous chaos was

399
00:11:33,133 --> 00:11:34,533
mainly due to the

400
00:11:34,533 --> 00:11:35,833
encroachment of evil foreign capitalism.

401
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:37,933
They were trying to turn the wealth earned from Venezuela's oil resources into

402
00:11:37,933 --> 00:11:39,233
their own profits.

403
00:11:39,233 --> 00:11:40,266
Inflation was

404
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:42,233
not a natural economic phenomenon;

405
00:11:42,233 --> 00:11:43,766
it was the work of evil capitalism, the machinations of

406
00:11:43,766 --> 00:11:44,633
hostile forces, their conspiracy.

407
00:11:47,233 --> 00:11:48,500
Therefore, he

408
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,099
implemented a series of sweeping reforms to public ownership. All

409
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,566
key industries,

410
00:11:51,566 --> 00:11:54,166
such as banking, infrastructure, transportation, electricity, and communications, were

411
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:54,833
nationalized,

412
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:56,566
while taxes on foreign companies were increased.

413
00:11:56,566 --> 00:11:58,166
This scared away most foreign investment.

414
00:11:58,166 --> 00:12:00,033
In 2001, he passed the Land Law,

415
00:12:00,033 --> 00:12:01,266
allowing the state to expropriate land and

416
00:12:01,266 --> 00:12:03,099
encouraging the establishment of small cooperatives at the grassroots level,

417
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,733
providing them with financial and technical support

418
00:12:04,733 --> 00:12:06,366
as an alternative to a market economy.

419
00:12:06,366 --> 00:12:08,300
Chávez also

420
00:12:08,299 --> 00:12:10,099
successfully brought the previously independent central bank under

421
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,900
government control through several legislations.

422
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:12,933
From then on, the government could decide how much money to print.

423
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:16,233
This actually foreshadowed the subsequent hyperinflation.

424
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:20,366
And of all Chávez's nationalization efforts, the

425
00:12:20,366 --> 00:12:22,033
most important one, which I haven't mentioned yet,

426
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:23,066
is oil.

427
00:12:23,566 --> 00:12:24,466
Are you wondering why? Did

428
00:12:24,466 --> 00:12:25,466
n't we just mention...?

429
00:12:25,466 --> 00:12:26,866
The oil industry

430
00:12:26,866 --> 00:12:27,900
was nationalized in 1976, and the

431
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:29,233
National Oil Company (PDC) was established.

432
00:12:31,266 --> 00:12:33,699
Although theoretically state-owned,

433
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:34,533
Venezuela

434
00:12:34,533 --> 00:12:36,633
was heavily reliant on foreign technology and capital, giving the

435
00:12:36,633 --> 00:12:38,433
West considerable influence; it was

436
00:12:38,433 --> 00:12:39,266
even considered a

437
00:12:39,266 --> 00:12:40,633
"state within a state."

438
00:12:40,899 --> 00:12:41,899
Chávez felt it was a disgrace that the

439
00:12:41,899 --> 00:12:43,766
nation's lifeline, the oil company,

440
00:12:43,766 --> 00:12:45,233
was controlled by the Americans and British, who were also taking a large

441
00:12:45,233 --> 00:12:46,300
cut of the profits.

442
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:48,233
So, in 2002,

443
00:12:48,233 --> 00:12:49,433
he placed trusted individuals on the

444
00:12:49,433 --> 00:12:51,266
PDC's board of directors

445
00:12:51,266 --> 00:12:52,199
to control him.

446
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,133
He appeared weekly on a television program

447
00:12:54,133 --> 00:12:55,766
called "Hello, Mr. President."

448
00:12:57,133 --> 00:12:58,499
On April 7th,

449
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,666
he used a whistle to

450
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:00,666
read out the

451
00:13:01,466 --> 00:13:02,700
names of high-ranking PDC executives who opposed him, firing them each time he blew the

452
00:13:04,299 --> 00:13:05,766
whistle.

453
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,066
This escalated,

454
00:13:10,066 --> 00:13:11,900
leading to a brief military coup

455
00:13:11,899 --> 00:13:12,899
attempt to depose Chávez, which he

456
00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:13,866
suppressed. In late

457
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:14,833
2002,

458
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:16,333
PDC employees

459
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:17,566
staged a massive strike, bringing

460
00:13:17,566 --> 00:13:19,200
oil production to a near standstill, dropping

461
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,600
from 3 million barrels per day.  The

462
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,000
daily output of oil fell to less than 300,000 barrels,

463
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,733
which was equivalent to the

464
00:13:22,733 --> 00:13:24,600
entire country's engine stopping.

465
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,200
This strike,

466
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,000
conservatively estimated,

467
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,466
brought Venezuela an economic loss of $10 billion,

468
00:13:28,466 --> 00:13:30,700
causing its GDP to decline by 27% in the first quarter of 2003.

469
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,766
But these short-term economic losses were relatively minor; the

470
00:13:33,766 --> 00:13:35,766
more fatal were the long-term losses.

471
00:13:35,766 --> 00:13:37,333
Chavez's response was very tough: "

472
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:38,366
You're on strike? You're not

473
00:13:38,366 --> 00:13:39,300
working?

474
00:13:39,299 --> 00:13:40,466
Fine, you don't need to come anymore. Fire everyone!" He

475
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,233
laid off nearly 20,000 employees at once.

476
00:13:43,299 --> 00:13:45,166
You might not think that many now,

477
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:47,133
but for the Venezuelan state oil company at the time, it meant

478
00:13:47,133 --> 00:13:49,233
almost half of its workforce was laid off. And

479
00:13:49,233 --> 00:13:49,966
think about it, this

480
00:13:49,966 --> 00:13:51,200
was different from typical layoffs. Usually, layoffs

481
00:13:52,033 --> 00:13:53,166
are selective, targeting those who can be laid off

482
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:53,899
easily.

483
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:56,033
But at that time, they targeted those who took to the streets. No matter

484
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,800
what you were, if you

485
00:13:57,799 --> 00:13:58,999
held key technologies or were in a

486
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,099
key position,

487
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,000
if you took to the streets, you were out. This

488
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:03,733
resulted in the layoff of many very core technical personnel.

489
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:05,399
After this turmoil,

490
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:07,033
Chavez did indeed successfully

491
00:14:07,033 --> 00:14:08,133
control the state oil company,

492
00:14:08,133 --> 00:14:09,899
but he also paid a very heavy price.

493
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:11,133
Not only did external technology withdraw...  The strike

494
00:14:11,133 --> 00:14:12,833
also resulted in the dismissal of a large portion of

495
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:14,366
Venezuela's technical backbone, causing Venezuela's oil technology to

496
00:14:14,366 --> 00:14:15,366
regress by more than a decade. Both

497
00:14:15,366 --> 00:14:17,300
management and technical capabilities have

498
00:14:17,299 --> 00:14:18,199
declined drastically.

499
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,099
With aging equipment and

500
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:20,966
technology loss, more than

501
00:14:20,966 --> 00:14:22,300
20 years later,

502
00:14:22,299 --> 00:14:23,199
its extraction capacity is less than

503
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,100
half of its peak before the strike. The

504
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,400
oil is simply sitting there, ready to be extracted, but it just can't be extracted. After only a

505
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:27,933
couple of digs,

506
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:29,433
it starts to tire and has to

507
00:14:29,433 --> 00:14:30,933
rest for half a day.

508
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,166
Many American oil giants, including ExxonMobil,

509
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,000
either had their assets forcibly seized

510
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,633
or were forced to accept new contracts in the period that followed. It's important to

511
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,500
understand that the

512
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,166
vast area of ​​refineries in the Gulf of Mexico were

513
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:44,899
designed specifically for Venezuelan heavy oil.

514
00:14:44,899 --> 00:14:45,533
This disruption is

515
00:14:45,533 --> 00:14:47,533
n't just about a few barrels of oil lost in the short term; it means that for

516
00:14:47,533 --> 00:14:48,933
decades to come,

517
00:14:48,933 --> 00:14:50,633
these newly heavily invested refineries

518
00:14:50,633 --> 00:14:51,533
will face a "famine"—they

519
00:14:51,533 --> 00:14:52,733
won't have oil to refine and will

520
00:14:52,733 --> 00:14:54,566
have to rely on Canadian heavy oil as a substitute.

521
00:14:54,566 --> 00:14:55,800
Therefore, as we analyzed before, the

522
00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:57,399
US's sudden attack on Venezuela

523
00:14:57,399 --> 00:14:58,499
must have had a significant reason: it's not just

524
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,366
because Venezuela has a large quantity of oil,

525
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:03,300
but because it's all heavy oil that meets the standards for US refineries.

526
00:15:04,566 --> 00:15:06,933
Well, things are starting to get complicated.

527
00:15:06,933 --> 00:15:07,999
Let's lay some groundwork first.

528
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,400
I'll give you some basic information to

529
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:09,833
explain

530
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:11,566
why oil-rich countries like Venezuela

531
00:15:11,566 --> 00:15:13,900
struggle to escape the so-called "oil curse."

532
00:15:13,899 --> 00:15:14,899
It's not as

533
00:15:14,899 --> 00:15:16,799
simple as money leading to corruption.

534
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,000
You see,

535
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,533
abundant natural resources

536
00:15:20,533 --> 00:15:21,199
lead to exports,

537
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,400
generating huge amounts of US dollars.

538
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:22,766
Then, these

539
00:15:22,766 --> 00:15:25,166
dollars are converted into the Bolivar,

540
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:27,033
causing its currency to appreciate continuously. With

541
00:15:27,033 --> 00:15:27,933
currency appreciation,

542
00:15:27,933 --> 00:15:28,799
domestically produced goods

543
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:30,333
become more expensive and less competitive compared to other countries.

544
00:15:31,133 --> 00:15:31,633
Meanwhile,

545
00:15:31,633 --> 00:15:33,366
goods from other countries become cheaper, leading Venezuela to

546
00:15:33,366 --> 00:15:35,000
favor imports.

547
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,333
This significantly weakens

548
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:38,200
Venezuela's domestic agriculture and manufacturing sectors,

549
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,933
causing them to gradually decline.

550
00:15:41,233 --> 00:15:42,166
So, over time, from a

551
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:43,799
national perspective,

552
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:45,233
its economic model becomes a

553
00:15:45,233 --> 00:15:46,133
relentless pursuit of oil exports

554
00:15:46,133 --> 00:15:47,033
and the purchase of other goods.

555
00:15:47,033 --> 00:15:48,433
You see,

556
00:15:48,433 --> 00:15:49,833
over 95% of its exports are oil, while

557
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:51,833
over 80% of its industrial raw materials and

558
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:53,200
over 60% of its food

559
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:53,800
are imported.

560
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:55,833
Its domestic manufacturing and agriculture decline, and the service

561
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:57,233
sector becomes the dominant industry.

562
00:15:57,233 --> 00:15:58,500
It's like a rich kid who,

563
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,400
because God has given them so much, ca

564
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:01,599
n't help but become corrupt.

565
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,700
This phenomenon has a specific term in economics:

566
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:04,733
"Dutch Disease," named after a similar situation that occurred in the

567
00:16:04,733 --> 00:16:06,533
Netherlands in the 1960s.

568
00:16:07,966 --> 00:16:09,400
However, I think it should actually be called

569
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:10,033
"Venezuelan Disease."

570
00:16:11,433 --> 00:16:12,966
In reality, if this so-called disease

571
00:16:12,966 --> 00:16:14,633
could continue indefinitely, it would

572
00:16:14,633 --> 00:16:15,699
n't be a major problem;

573
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:16,966
I could just keep selling oil to make money

574
00:16:16,966 --> 00:16:18,000
and buy other things. The

575
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,799
key issue is that

576
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:20,366
the country's industrial capacity has deteriorated; it

577
00:16:20,366 --> 00:16:21,700
can't produce anything of its own, meaning the

578
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:24,000
economy has lost its immunity.

579
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,533
A slight disturbance can cause it to collapse.

580
00:16:25,533 --> 00:16:26,799
This is why the

581
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:27,599
drop in oil prices in the 1980s

582
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,333
had such a severe impact on Venezuela's economy.

583
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:30,133
You might normally think, "If oil prices

584
00:16:30,133 --> 00:16:30,933
drop,

585
00:16:30,933 --> 00:16:31,899
you'll just earn less, it won't

586
00:16:31,899 --> 00:16:32,933
cause a collapse."

587
00:16:32,933 --> 00:16:33,333
Why?

588
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:34,900
Because its non-oil sectors

589
00:16:34,899 --> 00:16:36,366
have lost their capacity and

590
00:16:36,366 --> 00:16:37,033
completely deteriorated.

591
00:16:37,033 --> 00:16:38,933
And the key to all this

592
00:16:39,033 --> 00:16:39,966
is the exchange rate.

593
00:16:40,233 --> 00:16:42,366
Look at how Chavez messed with the oil companies;

594
00:16:42,366 --> 00:16:43,800
foreign investors

595
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:44,699
naturally avoided the country and

596
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:45,200
withdrew completely. The

597
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,200
domestic population also lacked confidence

598
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,033
in the country's economy and

599
00:16:47,033 --> 00:16:48,566
currency.

600
00:16:48,566 --> 00:16:50,500
They would try to exchange their money for

601
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,633
US dollars, leading to a

602
00:16:52,633 --> 00:16:53,599
continuous depreciation of the Bolivar and a

603
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,766
continuous rise in prices.

604
00:16:54,766 --> 00:16:56,733
Faced with these two classic economic difficulties,

605
00:16:56,733 --> 00:16:57,833
Chavez's response was

606
00:16:57,833 --> 00:16:59,033
remarkably simple and brutal. The

607
00:16:59,033 --> 00:17:00,333
exchange rate was falling?

608
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:00,966
No way!

609
00:17:00,966 --> 00:17:02,533
I set an official exchange rate.

610
00:17:02,533 --> 00:17:03,699
Prices were rising? No way!

611
00:17:04,433 --> 00:17:05,799
I set a price ceiling.

612
00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:08,499
This method of distorting supply and demand did

613
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,099
maintain Venezuela's purchasing power to some extent,

614
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,633
but at the cost of further deterioration of its productivity, further distortion of its

615
00:17:13,633 --> 00:17:15,366
economic structure, further

616
00:17:15,366 --> 00:17:17,366
growth of corruption and the black market, increased capital

617
00:17:17,366 --> 00:17:19,133
flight, and greater shortages of

618
00:17:19,133 --> 00:17:20,366
goods.

619
00:17:20,366 --> 00:17:21,800
At this point, Venezuela was terminally

620
00:17:21,799 --> 00:17:23,033
ill.

621
00:17:24,366 --> 00:17:24,733
However,

622
00:17:24,733 --> 00:17:26,433
things didn't deteriorate rapidly; instead,

623
00:17:26,433 --> 00:17:27,399
life in Venezuela gradually improved.

624
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:29,900
Why?

625
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,733
Because oil prices rebounded,

626
00:17:32,733 --> 00:17:34,500
and this time the rise was even more dramatic. In early

627
00:17:36,533 --> 00:17:37,233
2000, the

628
00:17:37,233 --> 00:17:38,933
global economy experienced a boom,

629
00:17:38,933 --> 00:17:40,133
oil demand surged, and

630
00:17:40,133 --> 00:17:42,033
oil prices increased sixfold in seven years.

631
00:17:42,033 --> 00:17:43,966
Venezuela's goldmine returned.

632
00:17:44,899 --> 00:17:47,499
With this influx of abundant dollars, the entire economy

633
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,966
returned to the prosperous state of the 1970s.

634
00:17:49,966 --> 00:17:50,633
Chavez,

635
00:17:50,633 --> 00:17:52,133
instead of using this respite

636
00:17:52,133 --> 00:17:53,166
to build a reserve fund, spent

637
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:55,099
heavily on subsidies,

638
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,933
providing almost free electricity and water to the public.

639
00:17:57,799 --> 00:17:58,999
Almost free oil,

640
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,333
very cheap food, and generous housing subsidies.

641
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:02,200
He also

642
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,366
established thousands of free medical clinics for the poor.

643
00:18:06,233 --> 00:18:07,833
At the time, gasoline in Venezuela was

644
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:09,033
even cheaper than bottled water;

645
00:18:09,033 --> 00:18:10,233
$100 worth of gasoline was

646
00:18:10,233 --> 00:18:12,366
enough to drive around the world several times over. The

647
00:18:12,366 --> 00:18:13,599
government became increasingly large and

648
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,333
bloated, with about a quarter of

649
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:15,366
Venezuela's working population

650
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:17,433
employed in government.

651
00:18:17,433 --> 00:18:18,733
Although the economic structure was unbalanced and

652
00:18:18,733 --> 00:18:19,833
basic necessities had to be imported, it

653
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:20,633
didn't matter, as

654
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:22,333
oil prices continued to rise, and

655
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:23,566
people had more money.

656
00:18:23,566 --> 00:18:25,400
Under Chavez's leadership, people's lives

657
00:18:25,399 --> 00:18:26,166
improved again. The

658
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:27,399
country's GDP

659
00:18:27,399 --> 00:18:29,166
quadrupled in just ten years.

660
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:31,299
Venezuela was gradually eliminating poverty, and its

661
00:18:31,299 --> 00:18:32,766
urbanization rate reached 90%, the

662
00:18:32,766 --> 00:18:34,233
highest in South America.

663
00:18:34,233 --> 00:18:35,166
At this rate, it

664
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:36,399
could soon once again become one of the

665
00:18:36,399 --> 00:18:37,999
world's richest countries.

666
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,633
To encourage borrowing,

667
00:18:40,633 --> 00:18:42,633
Chavez even set a cap on interest rates. The message was:

668
00:18:42,633 --> 00:18:43,900
borrow more,

669
00:18:43,899 --> 00:18:44,533
spend more,

670
00:18:44,533 --> 00:18:45,199
invest more,

671
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:45,766
don't save. The

672
00:18:45,766 --> 00:18:48,166
highest interest rate for credit cards at the time

673
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:49,033
was 29%, which

674
00:18:49,633 --> 00:18:51,333
may sound very high,

675
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:51,833
but you have to know that

676
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:53,600
Venezuela's inflation rate at the time

677
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,933
was 30%.  50%

678
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:55,499
means that

679
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,800
its loan interest rate is lower than the inflation rate; the

680
00:18:57,799 --> 00:18:59,233
real interest rate has always been negative.

681
00:18:59,233 --> 00:19:00,100
After you borrow money, the

682
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:02,200
amount you actually have to repay decreases,

683
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,700
so saving money results in increasingly lower returns.

684
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,000
Naturally, everyone borrows money

685
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:05,699
instead of saving. This

686
00:19:06,633 --> 00:19:07,966
led to a consumer frenzy in Venezuela.

687
00:19:07,966 --> 00:19:09,666
People used their wages to buy

688
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:11,799
cars, appliances, luxury goods, and travel

689
00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:12,599
abroad.

690
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,300
Many people bought cars not to drive, but as an

691
00:19:14,299 --> 00:19:15,199
investment;

692
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,400
as long as they could get a car loan, they would

693
00:19:16,399 --> 00:19:17,766
buy one without hesitation. The real

694
00:19:17,766 --> 00:19:19,366
estate bubble was even worse.

695
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:20,933
This negative real interest rate

696
00:19:20,933 --> 00:19:22,966
accelerated the entire economy, making

697
00:19:22,966 --> 00:19:24,300
capital turnover faster

698
00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:24,899
and faster.

699
00:19:26,466 --> 00:19:28,700
A very interesting consumer trend emerged:

700
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,800
cosmetic surgery. Venezuela

701
00:19:29,933 --> 00:19:32,399
became one of the countries in the Americas most fond of cosmetic surgery.

702
00:19:32,399 --> 00:19:32,999
Many women considered it an essential step in their

703
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,033
coming-of-age ceremony.

704
00:19:36,033 --> 00:19:36,933
Families with the means

705
00:19:36,933 --> 00:19:38,999
would prepare money for their daughters' cosmetic surgery.

706
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,300
Now, there's a social consensus

707
00:19:41,299 --> 00:19:43,799
that cosmetic surgery is a

708
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:45,433
"necessary path" to better career opportunities and higher social status. After all, with

709
00:19:45,433 --> 00:19:46,699
such high inflation, saving

710
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:47,666
money is impossible,

711
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:48,233
but cosmetic surgery is a

712
00:19:48,233 --> 00:19:50,066
long-term investment in one's life.

713
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:52,833
You should know that!

714
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:55,200
Venezuela is a global beauty pageant powerhouse,

715
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,833
arguably even the strongest in the world. It boasts the most wins in the

716
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:58,000
four major global beauty pageants,

717
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:01,699
earning it the nickname "Land of Beauties."

718
00:20:03,133 --> 00:20:05,233
It has a very comprehensive beauty pageant system.

719
00:20:05,233 --> 00:20:06,533
Not only does it have the highest-level "Miss Venezuela" title, but

720
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:08,900
every city, community,

721
00:20:08,899 --> 00:20:09,699
and even school

722
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,033
has its own beauty pageant,

723
00:20:11,033 --> 00:20:12,199
forming a

724
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,200
complete beauty selection mechanism. This has

725
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,500
naturally led to the rise of

726
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,666
a related industry chain including beauty pageant training and cosmetic surgery.

727
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,466
Okay, let's lighten the mood a bit and get back to the

728
00:20:22,299 --> 00:20:23,466
main point. In

729
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:26,699
2013, Hugo Chávez died of cancer.

730
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,100
During his 14 years in power,

731
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,733
oil prices initially climbed steadily,

732
00:20:29,733 --> 00:20:30,733
then fluctuated at high levels.

733
00:20:30,733 --> 00:20:32,400
He used the wealth generated by oil to directly improve the

734
00:20:32,399 --> 00:20:33,533
lives of Venezuelans. However,

735
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,466
some fundamental economic problems,

736
00:20:37,466 --> 00:20:38,666
such as structural issues,

737
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:39,433
corruption, and

738
00:20:39,433 --> 00:20:40,599
government inefficiency, continued to worsen

739
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,500
under the nourishment of the oil boom.

740
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,800
His successor, Nicolás Maduro,

741
00:20:45,799 --> 00:20:47,866
also from the United Socialist Party, was

742
00:20:48,933 --> 00:20:50,199
not so lucky.

743
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,300
Almost immediately after taking office, before he even had a chance to settle in,

744
00:20:52,233 --> 00:20:53,666
oil prices began to plummet.

745
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:55,099
Venezuela's good days are

746
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:55,666
over. The

747
00:20:56,733 --> 00:20:58,133
crisis of the 1980s is

748
00:20:58,133 --> 00:20:59,199
essentially repeating itself,

749
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,500
only this time with even greater intensity.

750
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,433
Its economic structure and inefficient state-owned enterprises

751
00:21:02,433 --> 00:21:03,933
simply cannot support domestic demand.

752
00:21:03,933 --> 00:21:05,533
Most necessities rely on imports, a constant stream of

753
00:21:05,533 --> 00:21:06,666
overseas purchases.

754
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:08,066
But with oil prices falling, Venezuela has run

755
00:21:08,066 --> 00:21:08,733
out of money and can no longer afford these goods. In

756
00:21:09,299 --> 00:21:09,999
five years,

757
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,133
Venezuela's imports have

758
00:21:11,133 --> 00:21:12,433
plummeted to one-sixth of their previous levels,

759
00:21:12,433 --> 00:21:14,066
plunging the country into severe shortages.

760
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:15,466
By 2015,

761
00:21:15,466 --> 00:21:16,600
due to severe shortages

762
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,900
and government price controls to

763
00:21:17,899 --> 00:21:18,599
prevent price increases,

764
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,700
many food items,

765
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:20,733
including toilet paper, were

766
00:21:20,733 --> 00:21:22,800
snapped up as soon as they hit the shelves.

767
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:24,899
Many supermarkets had to be fenced off with iron bars and patrolled with

768
00:21:24,899 --> 00:21:27,233
armed security personnel to

769
00:21:27,233 --> 00:21:28,533
prevent excessive riots

770
00:21:28,533 --> 00:21:30,133
or "zero-dollar purchases."

771
00:21:30,133 --> 00:21:32,066
You'd think there were some treasures inside!

772
00:21:32,066 --> 00:21:33,566
Eventually, the lines in front of supermarkets

773
00:21:33,566 --> 00:21:34,933
became so long and chaotic that

774
00:21:34,933 --> 00:21:37,199
the government implemented a quota system for supermarket visits, based on the

775
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,400
last digit of your ID card.

776
00:21:39,933 --> 00:21:41,066
For example, those with IDs ending in 0 or 1

777
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:42,433
could go to the supermarket on Mondays.

778
00:21:42,433 --> 00:21:43,533
2 and 3 are Tuesdays, and

779
00:21:43,533 --> 00:21:44,099
so on.

780
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,266
To prevent

781
00:21:45,266 --> 00:21:46,833
identity theft,

782
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:49,433
they also installed fingerprint recognition machines at supermarket entrances.

783
00:21:50,066 --> 00:21:52,133
During the peak of the shortage in 2017,

784
00:21:52,133 --> 00:21:54,333
many people survived by scavenging food from garbage.

785
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:55,300
Out of humanitarian concern,

786
00:21:55,299 --> 00:21:56,666
Colombia opened its borders

787
00:21:56,666 --> 00:21:58,499
to Venezuelans, providing some supplies

788
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,466
and food.

789
00:22:00,633 --> 00:22:02,266
But even with such shortages and

790
00:22:02,266 --> 00:22:03,033
soaring prices, there's one thing that

791
00:22:04,066 --> 00:22:05,100
Venezuela has always had very low prices,

792
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,500
even the lowest in the world:

793
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,900
gasoline.

794
00:22:07,899 --> 00:22:08,933
Note, not oil, but

795
00:22:08,933 --> 00:22:10,199
gasoline for cars.

796
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,000
Why? It's

797
00:22:11,933 --> 00:22:12,999
not that Venezuela has

798
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,099
low oil production costs. As

799
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:14,733
we just mentioned,

800
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:15,600
its equipment is outdated, and it

801
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,333
lacks skilled workers, so it has

802
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:18,266
almost no gasoline refining capacity and

803
00:22:18,266 --> 00:22:19,233
has to import gasoline. It's

804
00:22:19,233 --> 00:22:19,933
so cheap

805
00:22:19,933 --> 00:22:22,733
because the government continuously subsidizes it heavily,

806
00:22:22,733 --> 00:22:23,700
practically making it free.

807
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,400
A dollar can fill up a tank.

808
00:22:26,233 --> 00:22:28,400
But there's no such thing as a free lunch.

809
00:22:28,399 --> 00:22:29,433
Gasoline is practically free, so

810
00:22:29,433 --> 00:22:30,533
everyone rushes to fill up. The

811
00:22:30,533 --> 00:22:31,266
cost

812
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:34,233
shifts from money to waiting time—

813
00:22:34,233 --> 00:22:35,066
queueing.

814
00:22:35,066 --> 00:22:36,400
So many people just sit there all day.

815
00:22:36,399 --> 00:22:36,699
I'm telling you,

816
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:37,666
if you go to Venezuela—

817
00:22:37,666 --> 00:22:38,666
but I don't recommend it—

818
00:22:38,666 --> 00:22:39,366
you'll see

819
00:22:39,366 --> 00:22:40,833
a long line of cars queuing all day

820
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:41,700
long.

821
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:42,700
Almost motionless.

822
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:43,466
This isn't a traffic jam;

823
00:22:43,466 --> 00:22:44,733
they're just queuing for gas.

824
00:22:44,733 --> 00:22:46,600
In Caracas, the capital, it's considered relatively mild, with an

825
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,800
average wait of 5-6 hours. In

826
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:49,299
many places, the wait can be several days,

827
00:22:49,299 --> 00:22:49,866
even a week.

828
00:22:49,866 --> 00:22:51,933
People basically sit in their cars queuing during the day,

829
00:22:51,933 --> 00:22:53,133
then lock their cars and go home to sleep when the gas stations close at night, only to return

830
00:22:54,466 --> 00:22:56,700
the next day to queue again.

831
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,000
Of course, there are market-based gas

832
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,900
stations that charge international fuel prices, and there are

833
00:22:59,899 --> 00:23:00,633
n't queues there,

834
00:23:00,633 --> 00:23:01,933
but the vast majority of Venezuelans have become

835
00:23:01,933 --> 00:23:03,866
accustomed to this free gasoline,

836
00:23:03,866 --> 00:23:05,066
so they still queue.

837
00:23:06,066 --> 00:23:06,300
Think about it,

838
00:23:06,299 --> 00:23:07,699
this isn't just a single gas station

839
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:08,800
or a few cities;

840
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:10,033
it's a nationwide phenomenon. What a

841
00:23:10,033 --> 00:23:11,499
huge waste of resources! Queues at

842
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,833
supermarkets, queues at gas stations—

843
00:23:14,033 --> 00:23:16,599
countless people are queuing every moment across the country.

844
00:23:18,033 --> 00:23:19,033
And what's even more problematic is that

845
00:23:19,033 --> 00:23:20,099
such a large subsidy leads to

846
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,333
smuggling.

847
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:23,100
Many people smuggle this cheap gasoline

848
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:23,966
to neighboring Brazil

849
00:23:23,966 --> 00:23:25,100
or Colombia to

850
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:25,500
sell.

851
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:25,933
It's estimated that the

852
00:23:25,933 --> 00:23:27,899
value exceeds $10 billion annually,

853
00:23:27,899 --> 00:23:29,533
exacerbating the already severe gasoline shortage.

854
00:23:32,233 --> 00:23:33,533
Hearing this, you might be thinking, "

855
00:23:33,533 --> 00:23:34,733
When fuel prices were high, the

856
00:23:34,733 --> 00:23:35,933
government had so much money it was overflowing, so

857
00:23:35,933 --> 00:23:36,799
you could easily subsidize it.

858
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:37,499
That's understandable. But

859
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,733
now the economy is like this..."  With

860
00:23:38,733 --> 00:23:40,266
such a severe government fiscal deficit, why bother with

861
00:23:40,266 --> 00:23:41,866
subsidies?

862
00:23:41,866 --> 00:23:42,733
Just stop subsidizing! The

863
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,233
Maduro government is

864
00:23:46,233 --> 00:23:47,066
n't unwilling, it's afraid.

865
00:23:47,866 --> 00:23:49,099
People have become accustomed to

866
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,633
this near-free gasoline.

867
00:23:50,633 --> 00:23:51,900
If you liberalize it,

868
00:23:51,899 --> 00:23:53,866
the price could increase hundreds or thousands of times,

869
00:23:53,866 --> 00:23:56,800
triggering strong public discontent, anger, and protests. The

870
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:58,266
Maduro regime is already unstable,

871
00:23:58,266 --> 00:24:00,599
so they have no choice but to continue subsidies.

872
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,333
And what's more troublesome is the

873
00:24:01,333 --> 00:24:02,633
added layer of pressure:

874
00:24:02,633 --> 00:24:04,199
US sanctions.

875
00:24:06,466 --> 00:24:07,900
Since 2006, the

876
00:24:07,899 --> 00:24:09,866
US has imposed some small-scale sanctions on Venezuelan individuals,

877
00:24:09,866 --> 00:24:10,866
including Chavez himself.

878
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,533
But since 2014,

879
00:24:13,533 --> 00:24:14,299
the US has stated that the

880
00:24:14,299 --> 00:24:15,233
Venezuelan government

881
00:24:15,233 --> 00:24:16,300
has human rights abuses,

882
00:24:16,299 --> 00:24:17,299
undermined democracy,

883
00:24:17,299 --> 00:24:18,599
manipulated elections, etc., and will increase

884
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,700
sanctions.

885
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,866
Gradually, it has evolved from targeting individuals to

886
00:24:20,866 --> 00:24:22,466
sanctioning the entire country.

887
00:24:22,466 --> 00:24:24,266
Especially after Trump took office in his first term,

888
00:24:24,266 --> 00:24:25,799
he refused to recognize Maduro as president or the regime. The

889
00:24:26,733 --> 00:24:28,466
US, along with dozens of other countries,

890
00:24:28,466 --> 00:24:29,600
imposed

891
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,233
very strong and comprehensive economic sanctions on Venezuela. The

892
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,666
biggest blows were

893
00:24:33,666 --> 00:24:36,133
against the oil industry and financing transactions,

894
00:24:36,133 --> 00:24:37,799
freezing the assets of the national oil company,

895
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:38,999
prohibiting the US from buying its oil,

896
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,400
and restricting the Venezuelan government.

897
00:24:40,399 --> 00:24:42,099
All financing activities of oil companies were

898
00:24:42,733 --> 00:24:43,633
affected. Sanctions on the oil industry

899
00:24:43,633 --> 00:24:44,933
prevented the Venezuelan government from earning money, and

900
00:24:44,933 --> 00:24:45,833
restrictions on financing prevented

901
00:24:45,833 --> 00:24:47,000
them from borrowing. In short,

902
00:24:47,799 --> 00:24:49,066
Venezuela was deprived of funds. On

903
00:24:49,066 --> 00:24:50,133
one hand, there were US sanctions; on

904
00:24:50,133 --> 00:24:50,633
the other hand,

905
00:24:50,633 --> 00:24:52,466
its extraction capacity had severely declined after the major strike. As a result,

906
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,633
Venezuelan oil production

907
00:24:55,633 --> 00:24:57,133
plummeted by 90% after 2015. At

908
00:24:58,666 --> 00:24:58,699
this time, Venezuela's

909
00:24:58,700 --> 00:24:59,900
government debt was increasing, and the deficit was growing

910
00:24:59,899 --> 00:25:01,299
larger. In

911
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:02,133
2017, the

912
00:25:02,133 --> 00:25:03,833
government selectively defaulted on its foreign debt.

913
00:25:03,833 --> 00:25:05,833
Maduro had to activate his backup plan, the

914
00:25:05,833 --> 00:25:07,400
last thing economists wanted to see:

915
00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:09,833
he started the printing press.

916
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:13,666
We've discussed before how

917
00:25:13,666 --> 00:25:14,566
Zimbabwe's

918
00:25:14,566 --> 00:25:16,100
currency depreciated too quickly,

919
00:25:17,633 --> 00:25:19,566
requiring the continuous introduction of new currencies.

920
00:25:19,566 --> 00:25:20,966
Venezuela was similar.

921
00:25:21,633 --> 00:25:22,466
Its previous currency

922
00:25:22,466 --> 00:25:23,300
was called the Bolivar.

923
00:25:23,299 --> 00:25:24,433
Due to severe depreciation,

924
00:25:24,433 --> 00:25:26,166
in 2008, three zeros were removed, and

925
00:25:26,166 --> 00:25:27,599
a new currency

926
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,433
called the "Strong Bolivar" was introduced.

927
00:25:28,433 --> 00:25:30,966
That is, 1 Strong Bolivar = 1000 Bolivars.

928
00:25:30,966 --> 00:25:33,233
Initially, one US dollar was equal to 2.15 bolivars.

929
00:25:33,233 --> 00:25:34,833
Later, it gradually depreciated

930
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:36,600
to 10 bolivars per dollar.

931
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,033
You might think

932
00:25:37,033 --> 00:25:38,666
this rate of depreciation is acceptable,

933
00:25:38,666 --> 00:25:39,166
but let me tell you,

934
00:25:39,166 --> 00:25:40,199
this is just the official exchange rate. The

935
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,033
black market rate

936
00:25:41,033 --> 00:25:43,466
had already reached 10,000 bolivars per dollar.

937
00:25:43,466 --> 00:25:45,000
Because the black market was so rampant, the

938
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,599
official exchange rate had to follow suit, falling to

939
00:25:47,666 --> 00:25:50,833
4 million bolivars per dollar by August 2018.

940
00:25:50,833 --> 00:25:51,433
What to do?

941
00:25:51,433 --> 00:25:52,566
They rounded down five zeros and

942
00:25:52,566 --> 00:25:53,666
introduced a new currency unit

943
00:25:53,666 --> 00:25:54,866
called the "Sovereign Bolivar."

944
00:25:54,866 --> 00:25:57,633
One Sovereign Bolivar equals 100,000 bolivars.

945
00:25:59,833 --> 00:26:00,600
By 2019,

946
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,600
Venezuela's inflation

947
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,266
had exceeded 300,000%, meaning 30,000

948
00:26:03,266 --> 00:26:04,399
yuan today would be

949
00:26:04,399 --> 00:26:05,466
equivalent to one yuan next year.

950
00:26:05,466 --> 00:26:07,566
So in 2020, they introduced a new currency

951
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:08,700
called the "Digital Bolivar,"

952
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,700
rounding down six zeros from the Sovereign Bolivar. Does

953
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:11,933
n't that sound like a tongue twister? The

954
00:26:11,933 --> 00:26:12,833
current exchange rate is approximately

955
00:26:12,833 --> 00:26:14,966
325 digital bolivars per dollar.

956
00:26:14,966 --> 00:26:15,866
If we use 2000...  The

957
00:26:15,866 --> 00:26:17,266
original version of the bolivar,

958
00:26:17,266 --> 00:26:19,499
if you add 14 zeros after the 325,

959
00:26:20,399 --> 00:26:23,799
becomes 3.25 trillion bolivars.

960
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,599
You don't need much economic knowledge to

961
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,300
imagine that

962
00:26:26,299 --> 00:26:27,999
when prices rise to this level, the

963
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,866
economy is essentially paralyzed.

964
00:26:29,866 --> 00:26:31,400
Everyone's money is burning their hands; they just want to

965
00:26:31,399 --> 00:26:32,299
spend it as quickly as possible.

966
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:34,299
You don't care about prices;

967
00:26:34,299 --> 00:26:35,699
you buy toilet paper if you see it,

968
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:36,833
hoard it if you can, and

969
00:26:36,833 --> 00:26:38,466
forget about investment and production.

970
00:26:39,899 --> 00:26:41,666
Historically, once a country falls into this vortex of hyperinflation, it

971
00:26:41,666 --> 00:26:43,233
's very difficult to stop or escape.

972
00:26:43,366 --> 00:26:45,166
But look at Venezuela's hyperinflation; it

973
00:26:45,166 --> 00:26:47,366
miraculously dropped in 2020.

974
00:26:47,366 --> 00:26:48,300
Why? Well, it's

975
00:26:48,833 --> 00:26:49,833
not miraculous at all.

976
00:26:49,833 --> 00:26:50,633
Venezuelans

977
00:26:50,633 --> 00:26:52,199
completely abandoned their own currency.

978
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,500
Strong bolivar,

979
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:54,433
sovereign bolivar—

980
00:26:54,433 --> 00:26:56,366
even if you gave me a "super invincible bolivar,"

981
00:26:56,366 --> 00:26:57,166
I wouldn't believe it. The

982
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,366
entire country began

983
00:27:00,366 --> 00:27:01,366
using the US dollar for transactions on a large scale,

984
00:27:01,366 --> 00:27:02,200
becoming dollarized.

985
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,400
Now, when you walk into a restaurant, a

986
00:27:03,399 --> 00:27:04,599
roadside stall, or a supermarket,

987
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,700
most prices are in US dollars. The

988
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:06,833
numerical bolivar

989
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:08,266
hardly circulates at all.

990
00:27:08,266 --> 00:27:08,866
And you should know that the US

991
00:27:08,866 --> 00:27:10,099
dollar is

992
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,200
not even the official currency in Venezuela.

993
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,166
Therefore, US dollar bills

994
00:27:12,166 --> 00:27:12,899
are extremely rare;

995
00:27:12,899 --> 00:27:14,499
you simply can't withdraw them from ATMs,

996
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,433
especially small change.

997
00:27:16,399 --> 00:27:17,999
This leads to a rather amusing phenomenon:

998
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,566
for example, if you go to a restaurant and

999
00:27:19,566 --> 00:27:20,700
spend $13,

1000
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,900
don't expect the restaurant to give you the two dollars in change.

1001
00:27:22,899 --> 00:27:23,866
You just order a few more things to make it

1002
00:27:23,866 --> 00:27:25,300
$15, and

1003
00:27:25,299 --> 00:27:26,233
everyone's happy.

1004
00:27:26,466 --> 00:27:28,700
So now,

1005
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:30,233
US dollar payment apps like Zelle and PayPal

1006
00:27:30,233 --> 00:27:31,500
are very common in Venezuela.

1007
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,066
In other words, a

1008
00:27:32,066 --> 00:27:33,800
large number of transactions in Venezuela

1009
00:27:33,799 --> 00:27:35,499
are actually completed between US banks.

1010
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,166
You see, the Venezuelan banks and

1011
00:27:37,166 --> 00:27:38,899
government are quite helpless.

1012
00:27:40,666 --> 00:27:41,499
In the last ten years,

1013
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,800
over 8 million people have fled Venezuela—

1014
00:27:43,799 --> 00:27:45,433
more than a quarter of its population. They all

1015
00:27:45,433 --> 00:27:46,499
left in just a few years,

1016
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,400
including many

1017
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:49,533
talented people, wealthy individuals, and students. Everyone who could leave did.

1018
00:27:51,799 --> 00:27:53,533
Originally, the

1019
00:27:53,533 --> 00:27:54,499
problems of corruption and economic structure

1020
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,800
weren't entirely unsolvable,

1021
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:57,033
but now that people are gone, it's an

1022
00:27:57,033 --> 00:27:58,999
irreversible loss. The

1023
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,533
long-term impact on Venezuela is

1024
00:28:00,533 --> 00:28:01,733
devastating.

1025
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,933
Many people earn less than $10 a month;

1026
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:06,466
less than $10 a month

1027
00:28:06,466 --> 00:28:08,233
is simply not enough to make ends meet.

1028
00:28:08,833 --> 00:28:09,533
Most of them

1029
00:28:09,533 --> 00:28:11,133
rely on relatives abroad.

1030
00:28:11,133 --> 00:28:12,599
Sending money to make a living:

1031
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:15,700
Many of these people are descendants of immigrants who came to Venezuela in the 1950s and 60s

1032
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,866
full of hope.

1033
00:28:17,866 --> 00:28:18,900
Who knew that after so many years of

1034
00:28:18,899 --> 00:28:20,499
ups and downs,

1035
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,599
their children would now be

1036
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,266
forced to flee the country?

1037
00:28:23,266 --> 00:28:24,299
This wave of

1038
00:28:25,366 --> 00:28:25,900
immigration has

1039
00:28:25,899 --> 00:28:26,866
led to hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan immigrants being accepted by

1040
00:28:26,866 --> 00:28:28,200
South American countries like Colombia,

1041
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,733
Brazil, Peru, and Argentina in the past two years. This has

1042
00:28:32,266 --> 00:28:34,399
indeed taken away many jobs in the short term,

1043
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:36,133
causing considerable instability throughout South America.

1044
00:28:36,133 --> 00:28:36,900
Therefore, this wave of immigration

1045
00:28:36,899 --> 00:28:38,799
can be considered one of the most significant crises South America has faced recently. In

1046
00:28:41,166 --> 00:28:41,799
2020, the

1047
00:28:41,799 --> 00:28:42,999
country's GDP

1048
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,833
fell to only 15% of what it was ten years ago,

1049
00:28:44,833 --> 00:28:46,600
even lower than in 1980.

1050
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,000
However, after our analysis,

1051
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,900
you can probably see that the

1052
00:28:48,899 --> 00:28:50,433
high GDP a decade ago

1053
00:28:50,433 --> 00:28:52,133
didn't mean the economy was booming. The

1054
00:28:52,133 --> 00:28:53,333
recent economic collapse is

1055
00:28:53,333 --> 00:28:55,033
not just a problem of the last decade or so, nor is it solely the

1056
00:28:55,033 --> 00:28:57,466
fault of the Maduro and Chavez governments. It's a

1057
00:28:59,666 --> 00:29:01,799
concentrated eruption of various deep-seated problems accumulated over the past century.

1058
00:29:03,733 --> 00:29:05,800
In fact, if you look at Venezuelan urban development, it's

1059
00:29:05,799 --> 00:29:07,999
not like many African countries where poverty is the norm;

1060
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,033
you can see that it was once wealthy.

1061
00:29:10,033 --> 00:29:10,866
But in the last 10 years, the

1062
00:29:10,866 --> 00:29:11,800
government has indeed run out of money.

1063
00:29:11,799 --> 00:29:13,333
Basically, the management of public order and

1064
00:29:13,333 --> 00:29:14,233
public welfare has become largely laissez-faire. Overall, public

1065
00:29:16,433 --> 00:29:18,133
security is terrible.

1066
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:19,899
So, starting a few years ago,

1067
00:29:19,899 --> 00:29:20,799
many countries' officials

1068
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:22,199
advised their citizens

1069
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,266
not to travel to Venezuela, saying

1070
00:29:23,266 --> 00:29:24,099
it was too dangerous. There

1071
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:26,533
's an area in the Venezuelan capital called Petare.

1072
00:29:26,533 --> 00:29:28,033
You see the walls painted in vibrant colors,

1073
00:29:28,033 --> 00:29:28,633
quite beautiful,

1074
00:29:28,633 --> 00:29:29,333
but in reality,

1075
00:29:29,333 --> 00:29:31,466
it's one of the largest slums in Latin America,

1076
00:29:31,466 --> 00:29:32,933
housing over 2 million people. The

1077
00:29:32,933 --> 00:29:35,299
houses on several hills are extremely densely packed, one

1078
00:29:35,299 --> 00:29:36,033
next to another. There's

1079
00:29:36,033 --> 00:29:37,533
no stable water or electricity supply,

1080
00:29:37,533 --> 00:29:38,466
and no sewage system. It

1081
00:29:39,899 --> 00:29:41,533
looks peaceful during the day

1082
00:29:41,533 --> 00:29:42,899
because everyone is either sleeping

1083
00:29:42,899 --> 00:29:43,933
or working in the city.

1084
00:29:43,933 --> 00:29:44,633
But at night,

1085
00:29:44,633 --> 00:29:46,500
it becomes a haven for gangs,

1086
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,666
and one of the

1087
00:29:47,666 --> 00:29:49,433
areas with the highest crime and murder rates in the world. Even the

1088
00:29:50,333 --> 00:29:52,733
most daring social media bloggers

1089
00:29:52,733 --> 00:29:54,266
would need several experienced guides,

1090
00:29:55,066 --> 00:29:56,900
traveling in groups, and only dare to go there in a car. And

1091
00:29:56,899 --> 00:29:58,733
even after leaving the slum, the security situation

1092
00:29:58,733 --> 00:29:59,800
in the capital, Caracas, is

1093
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:01,133
n't good either.

1094
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:02,199
If you're not careful, you might

1095
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,300
wander around in places you shouldn't be.

1096
00:30:04,366 --> 00:30:05,833
Oops

1097
00:30:05,833 --> 00:30:07,033
You'll be out of money. If you drive in its capital, you'll

1098
00:30:07,033 --> 00:30:07,633
find that at

1099
00:30:07,633 --> 00:30:08,400
night, the

1100
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:09,933
traffic lights are basically useless;

1101
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:10,666
nobody cares.

1102
00:30:10,666 --> 00:30:12,866
Everyone just runs red lights.

1103
00:30:12,866 --> 00:30:13,666
Why? It's

1104
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,666
not that all Venezuelans are thugs or want to break the law. It's

1105
00:30:16,433 --> 00:30:18,466
mainly because the security situation is so bad. A

1106
00:30:18,466 --> 00:30:20,500
couple of years ago, there were

1107
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,199
incidents of people being robbed or even shot while waiting at red lights. This has

1108
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,900
led to people being afraid to linger and speeding through

1109
00:30:23,899 --> 00:30:25,733
red lights.

1110
00:30:25,733 --> 00:30:26,300
And the traffic police

1111
00:30:26,299 --> 00:30:27,399
simply don't care. The

1112
00:30:27,399 --> 00:30:28,233
whole city, the

1113
00:30:28,233 --> 00:30:29,000
whole country, is

1114
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:29,400
basically in

1115
00:30:29,399 --> 00:30:31,933
a state of complete traffic freedom. Take the

1116
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,333
subway, for example. At

1117
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:35,000
first glance, it seems

1118
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,866
much better than the New York subway.

1119
00:30:36,866 --> 00:30:37,900
It was

1120
00:30:37,899 --> 00:30:39,199
built in the early 2000s when Venezuela was particularly wealthy.

1121
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:39,866
But now, the

1122
00:30:39,866 --> 00:30:41,033
government doesn't have the ability

1123
00:30:41,033 --> 00:30:42,533
or resources to operate the subway. The

1124
00:30:42,533 --> 00:30:44,499
entire Caracas subway is free. The

1125
00:30:44,933 --> 00:30:47,033
automatic ticket machines and fare gates are just for show, and the escalators are out of service. The

1126
00:30:48,233 --> 00:30:49,900
subway is still running,

1127
00:30:49,899 --> 00:30:50,733
but not frequently. Since it's

1128
00:30:50,733 --> 00:30:51,633
free,

1129
00:30:51,633 --> 00:30:52,733
people rely on their own

1130
00:30:52,733 --> 00:30:53,900
ability to squeeze on and sit down. There's

1131
00:30:53,899 --> 00:30:54,866
no air conditioning inside.

1132
00:30:54,866 --> 00:30:55,333
Venezuela

1133
00:30:55,333 --> 00:30:56,600
relies on hydroelectric power plants built over half a century ago

1134
00:30:57,733 --> 00:30:59,600
to power its entire population.

1135
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,100
However, due to a lack of skilled workers,

1136
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:01,866
poor maintenance, and a

1137
00:31:01,866 --> 00:31:03,000
lack of alternative energy sources, power

1138
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,500
outages

1139
00:31:05,833 --> 00:31:08,133
occur frequently. In 2019, a massive nationwide blackout

1140
00:31:08,133 --> 00:31:09,033
lasted over a week, resulting in

1141
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:10,533
at least 43 deaths.

1142
00:31:10,533 --> 00:31:11,699
Subsequent investigations revealed that over

1143
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,633
$80 billion of the $100 billion invested in the power system by Congress had been

1144
00:31:15,533 --> 00:31:17,666
misappropriated, rendering over 14 thermal power plants inoperable.

1145
00:31:17,666 --> 00:31:19,699
This illustrates the extent of corruption involved. Having

1146
00:31:21,399 --> 00:31:23,266
made numerous videos analyzing national economies,

1147
00:31:23,266 --> 00:31:23,899
I've found that

1148
00:31:23,899 --> 00:31:25,833
you can't just rely on research reports and

1149
00:31:25,833 --> 00:31:26,533
economic data.

1150
00:31:26,533 --> 00:31:28,866
If we only focus on economic analysis, we

1151
00:31:29,466 --> 00:31:31,200
might develop misconceptions about the lives of the people in that country.

1152
00:31:32,066 --> 00:31:33,900
Instead, you should watch videos and vlogs made by people living there.

1153
00:31:35,066 --> 00:31:36,033
I've watched many of these,

1154
00:31:36,033 --> 00:31:38,299
observing how people there describe their lives.

1155
00:31:38,299 --> 00:31:39,433
I've come to a deep impression

1156
00:31:39,433 --> 00:31:40,299
that their lives,

1157
00:31:40,299 --> 00:31:41,499
from the

1158
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,433
perspective of their happiness index and their expressed emotions, are

1159
00:31:43,433 --> 00:31:45,199
not as dire or unfortunate as people imagine based on economic data. While the

1160
00:31:48,466 --> 00:31:50,233
economic problems we've discussed

1161
00:31:50,233 --> 00:31:51,233
certainly exist,

1162
00:31:51,233 --> 00:31:53,100
Venezuela's economy is indeed in a mess.

1163
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,200
But South Americans are

1164
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,100
truly optimistic,

1165
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:55,866
easygoing, and know how to

1166
00:31:55,866 --> 00:31:56,933
enjoy life. They complain

1167
00:31:56,933 --> 00:31:57,666
about wages,

1168
00:31:57,666 --> 00:31:58,433
prices,

1169
00:31:58,433 --> 00:31:58,999
and the government,

1170
00:32:00,266 --> 00:32:01,733
but they also laugh at the drop of a hat,

1171
00:32:01,733 --> 00:32:02,866
dance to music, and watch

1172
00:32:02,866 --> 00:32:04,200
baseball on weekends.

1173
00:32:06,833 --> 00:32:08,466
Caracas, the capital, is indeed chaotic with a

1174
00:32:08,466 --> 00:32:09,233
high crime rate,

1175
00:32:09,233 --> 00:32:10,900
but it's not like everyone is on edge or

1176
00:32:10,899 --> 00:32:11,599
afraid to go out. Everyone goes about their business as

1177
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,866
usual—

1178
00:32:12,866 --> 00:32:13,666
working, going to school. If

1179
00:32:16,433 --> 00:32:18,133
you see a gang doing business somewhere, just avoid it.

1180
00:32:18,133 --> 00:32:19,766
Don't stop at red lights.

1181
00:32:21,666 --> 00:32:22,299
In recent years,

1182
00:32:22,299 --> 00:32:24,299
with Venezuela's full dollarization,

1183
00:32:24,299 --> 00:32:25,633
inflation has largely disappeared. The

1184
00:32:25,633 --> 00:32:27,433
government's finances are extremely strained,

1185
00:32:27,433 --> 00:32:28,099
forcing them to abandon

1186
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:30,033
the old, all-encompassing welfare system. The

1187
00:32:30,866 --> 00:32:33,033
"magical economic phenomenon" of long queues at gas stations and supermarket rationing is

1188
00:32:33,033 --> 00:32:33,899
gradually disappearing.

1189
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,266
Although supermarket shelves are once again full of goods,

1190
00:32:37,266 --> 00:32:38,399
market prices

1191
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:39,933
mean that Venezuelan goods are more expensive

1192
00:32:39,933 --> 00:32:41,466
than those in Miami across the border.

1193
00:32:41,466 --> 00:32:43,933
Real wages are still less than they were 50 years ago.

1194
00:32:43,933 --> 00:32:45,433
Gangs demand protection money,

1195
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,033
and police frequently collect "tolls." The

1196
00:32:47,033 --> 00:32:49,033
whole country has fallen into a jungle law mentality,

1197
00:32:49,033 --> 00:32:50,899
feeling somewhat like a state of semi-anarchy.

1198
00:32:52,133 --> 00:32:53,299
After detaining Maduro,

1199
00:32:53,299 --> 00:32:54,333
the US is likely more focused on

1200
00:32:54,333 --> 00:32:56,066
Venezuela's oil and politics, and

1201
00:32:56,066 --> 00:32:57,700
less likely to invest significant effort

1202
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,200
in reversing its economic structure and

1203
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,000
social order.

1204
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:00,699
Overall,

1205
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,466
its economic development faces extremely high uncertainty,

1206
00:33:02,466 --> 00:33:04,033
essentially entering a shock therapy phase.

1207
00:33:07,333 --> 00:33:09,200
An economy that, when resource-rich and with

1208
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,333
ample income,

1209
00:33:10,333 --> 00:33:11,600
failed to utilize its oil resources effectively,

1210
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,300
instead fostering government corruption and allowing its

1211
00:33:13,299 --> 00:33:14,799
productivity to decline,

1212
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:16,233
exacerbating economic imbalances,

1213
00:33:16,233 --> 00:33:18,033
coupled with government price controls,

1214
00:33:18,033 --> 00:33:18,866
foreign exchange controls, and

1215
00:33:18,866 --> 00:33:20,433
interest rate controls—a

1216
00:33:33,899 --> 00:33:36,266
short-sighted approach leading to hyperinflation—is like a child whose mind is still developing. They make mistakes and experience confusion. Normally, harsh reality would immediately teach them a lesson—this is an automatic error-correction mechanism. However, if someone starts with astronomical wealth,

1217
00:33:36,266 --> 00:33:37,233
this mechanism

1218
00:33:37,233 --> 00:33:38,133
may fail.

1219
00:33:39,333 --> 00:33:40,433
Small economic imbalances,

1220
00:33:40,433 --> 00:33:41,466
minor corruption, and

1221
00:33:41,466 --> 00:33:42,600
small price distortions, without timely feedback

1222
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,600
in an environment of continuous wealth inflow,

1223
00:33:45,866 --> 00:33:47,200
will stray further and further from the right

1224
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,533
path.

1225
00:33:48,533 --> 00:33:50,199
When the economy is already terminally ill, a

1226
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,333
sudden drop in oil prices

1227
00:33:52,333 --> 00:33:53,533
could trigger a vicious cycle.

1228
00:33:53,533 --> 00:33:55,566
After that, it would be difficult for him to climb out again.

1229
00:33:56,866 --> 00:33:57,533
So sometimes, having

1230
00:33:57,533 --> 00:33:59,599
too much money and spending it in the wrong places can be

1231
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,100
more fatal than having no money at all.

1232
00:34:01,233 --> 00:34:02,866
As Venezuela's former energy minister,

1233
00:34:02,866 --> 00:34:04,500
also known as the father of OPEC, said,

1234
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,333
oil will bring us destruction;

1235
00:34:06,333 --> 00:34:08,033
it is the devil's excrement.

1236
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,733
Perhaps for Venezuela,

1237
00:34:09,733 --> 00:34:11,533
oil truly is a curse.
