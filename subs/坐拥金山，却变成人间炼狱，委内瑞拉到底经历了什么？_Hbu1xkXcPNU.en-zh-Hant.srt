1
00:00:00,433 --> 00:00:01,966
Today we're going to talk about a country that

2
00:00:01,966 --> 00:00:03,733
can be considered one of the biggest economic disasters in modern human history:

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:06,533
Venezuela.

4
00:00:08,133 --> 00:00:09,666
As the country with the world's largest oil reserves, it started with a

5
00:00:09,666 --> 00:00:10,899
hand of

6
00:00:10,899 --> 00:00:11,799
"two kings and four twos,"

7
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,199
yet its GDP plummeted by 80% in less than a decade.

8
00:00:15,899 --> 00:00:16,833
According to UN estimates, by

9
00:00:16,833 --> 00:00:18,566
2024, 82% of the population will

10
00:00:18,566 --> 00:00:19,866
live below the poverty line. The

11
00:00:19,866 --> 00:00:22,066
capital, Caracas, has a poverty line, an entire mountain of slums, and one of the

12
00:00:22,066 --> 00:00:23,466
highest murder rates in the world.

13
00:00:24,666 --> 00:00:26,733
In this country where gas is practically free, even basic necessities like

14
00:00:26,733 --> 00:00:28,233
toilet paper, food, and medicine are in

15
00:00:28,233 --> 00:00:30,066
extreme shortage.

16
00:00:30,066 --> 00:00:31,799
Supermarkets are so crowded that you have to be queuing to buy groceries,

17
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:32,866
checking the last digit of your ID card, and they have

18
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:35,033
very strict armed security. For over a decade, Venezuela has been mired in hyperinflation, where

19
00:00:37,366 --> 00:00:38,600
money is weighed by the kilogram. How absurd is

20
00:00:41,199 --> 00:00:42,133
this rate of currency

21
00:00:42,133 --> 00:00:43,066
devaluation?

22
00:00:43,066 --> 00:00:44,199
If you stacked

23
00:00:44,199 --> 00:00:45,466
100-bolivar bills from 20 years ago one by

24
00:00:45,466 --> 00:00:46,466
one, and

25
00:00:46,466 --> 00:00:48,499
physically filled the entire Bird's Nest stadium—

26
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:49,333
or even

27
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:50,533
40 Bird's Nest stadiums—how

28
00:00:50,533 --> 00:00:52,133
much would that be worth? It's only enough to

29
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:53,999
buy a McDonald's hamburger,

30
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,366
and you can't even get fries and a soda,

31
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:02,666
etc.—these are some of the most horrific concepts. It turns out that all these factors have manifested in this

32
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,399
one country. So don't think we're talking about Venezuela today just because it's a political hotspot. Let's take a look at how it managed to turn such a promising situation around. Venezuela is a country on the northern coast of South America, with a

33
00:01:27,533 --> 00:01:29,600
land area of ​​910,000 square kilometers, slightly larger than the three northeastern provinces of China combined. It currently has a population of

34
00:01:30,533 --> 00:01:32,699
approximately 28 million. Originally inhabited by indigenous Native Americans, it was ruled by the Spanish for nearly

35
00:01:51,533 --> 00:01:52,800
300 years, starting in the 16th century. Therefore, it still speaks Spanish. It gained independence in 1830,

36
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:56,899
becoming one of the first countries in South America to break free from Spanish rule. However, the key factor truly influencing its development wasn't independence or colonization, but something else entirely. In 1914, Venezuela drilled its first commercial oil well, discovering oil. In the following 21 years, it transformed from an unknown country into the world's second-largest oil producer,

37
00:01:56,899 --> 00:01:57,599
second only to the United States.

38
00:02:05,133 --> 00:02:06,499
We often say oil is black gold, and this windfall became a boon for Venezuela's then-dictator, Gómez. He became the richest person in all of Latin America. We've discussed this before regarding oil. In the early days,

39
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,300
global oil resources were monopolized by

40
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:15,199
seven British and American oil companies, known as the "Seven Sisters,"

41
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:23,533
forming a cartel.

42
00:02:23,533 --> 00:02:24,433
Venezuela's share was distributed among three of these: Gulf Oil, Standard Oil, and Shell. Initially, these three had considerable influence, as oil extraction and transportation technology was relatively scarce. Venezuela,

43
00:02:24,433 --> 00:02:26,133
being a small, inland country, only

44
00:02:26,133 --> 00:02:27,733
received a small share of the oil profits. However, after World War II, these

45
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:29,599
oil-producing nations began to realize

46
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:38,199
something was amiss. "So many companies can

47
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:47,333
extract oil, but only I possess this resource. This is the scarcest and most valuable resource. I am the landlord! What are

48
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:48,066
you Seven Sisters doing, arguing with me?" So, Venezuela joined forces with the Seven Sisters to negotiate, signing the famous 50/50 revenue-sharing agreement. Simply put, "I let you extract oil here, and we'll split the profits 50/50." Later, Venezuela

49
00:02:48,066 --> 00:02:49,866
also joined forces with four Middle Eastern countries to

50
00:02:49,866 --> 00:02:51,866
establish OPEC, which significantly

51
00:02:53,733 --> 00:02:54,733
boosted the Venezuelan government's revenue.

52
00:02:54,733 --> 00:02:56,266
This gold mine grew even larger. In

53
00:02:56,266 --> 00:02:57,199
just five years,

54
00:02:57,199 --> 00:02:58,566
government revenue increased sixfold.

55
00:02:58,566 --> 00:02:59,833
But the real golden age was

56
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:00,966
yet to come.

57
00:03:00,966 --> 00:03:01,899
The wealth accumulated before was merely

58
00:03:01,899 --> 00:03:03,199
small-scale. In

59
00:03:03,966 --> 00:03:05,733
1973, the Yom Kippur War broke out, also

60
00:03:05,733 --> 00:03:07,766
known as the "Fourth Middle East War."

61
00:03:07,766 --> 00:03:09,333
Arab countries in the Middle East joined hands and collectively

62
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:10,966
imposed an oil embargo on the West,

63
00:03:10,966 --> 00:03:12,099
plunging the world into an oil shortage. Oil

64
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,600
prices quadrupled in a short period,

65
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,199
from $3 per

66
00:03:20,766 --> 00:03:23,366
barrel to $12, known as the First Oil Crisis. A few years later, in 1979, the

67
00:03:32,866 --> 00:03:34,066
Second Oil Crisis broke out, with oil prices soaring further to $35 per barrel—ten times the price of ten years earlier! This led to global inflation and economic stagnation. But for Venezuela, it was like a windfall. A huge windfall!

68
00:03:34,066 --> 00:03:35,999
Venezuela was probably the biggest beneficiary of these two consecutive oil crises. Venezuela,

69
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,533
you see, is an oil-exporting country, has

70
00:03:37,533 --> 00:03:38,766
little connection to the Middle East, and is

71
00:03:38,766 --> 00:03:39,899
so close to the United States.

72
00:03:39,899 --> 00:03:41,566
In 1976, the Venezuelan government

73
00:03:41,566 --> 00:03:43,366
fully nationalized its oil industry,

74
00:03:43,366 --> 00:03:45,866
establishing its own state-owned oil company, PDVSA.

75
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:47,899
If the previous high oil prices were

76
00:03:47,899 --> 00:03:49,433
a goldmine,

77
00:03:49,433 --> 00:03:50,533
this time it was an unimaginable windfall. In

78
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:53,966
10 years,

79
00:03:53,966 --> 00:03:55,499
Venezuela's GDP increased sixfold.

80
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,333
The capital, Caracas,

81
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:58,166
saw the construction of South America's most modern highways,

82
00:03:58,166 --> 00:03:59,500
skyscrapers, and university towns. State-owned

83
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,433
enterprises

84
00:04:00,433 --> 00:04:01,933
expanded rapidly, employing 300,000 people. You'd find a waiter standing

85
00:04:03,633 --> 00:04:04,399
in an elevator,

86
00:04:04,399 --> 00:04:05,166
in a public bathroom, or outside an

87
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:05,966
office –

88
00:04:07,766 --> 00:04:09,166
that's a job. The

89
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:10,133
government had plenty of money. Meanwhile, private

90
00:04:10,133 --> 00:04:12,199
enterprises shrank as they moved into the city.

91
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:12,966
But that didn't matter;

92
00:04:12,966 --> 00:04:14,233
even if large companies weren't profitable, they

93
00:04:14,233 --> 00:04:15,933
were supported by government subsidies. The

94
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,633
Venezuelan bolivar

95
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:20,366
became one of the world's strongest currencies

96
00:04:20,366 --> 00:04:21,633
because of its extremely strong exchange rate.

97
00:04:21,633 --> 00:04:22,799
At that time, Venezuela's middle class

98
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,366
would even go shopping in Miami on weekends. As long as

99
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,833
oil prices remained high, the

100
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:29,799
Venezuelan government had a continuous supply of oil.

101
00:04:34,533 --> 00:04:35,833
As long as oil prices remain high, every citizen can relax and enjoy a life of high wages and high welfare. High oil prices provide

102
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:37,133
enough

103
00:04:37,133 --> 00:04:39,299
incentive for the entire economy to stand at the top of the world; no

104
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,933
economic problem is a problem.

105
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:45,333
However, this didn't last long. In the

106
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:47,233
1980s, international oil prices began to plummet. The

107
00:04:47,233 --> 00:04:49,133
Venezuelan government initially hoped

108
00:04:49,133 --> 00:04:50,533
this was just a temporary setback.

109
00:04:50,533 --> 00:04:52,366
So, although government revenue began to decline,

110
00:04:52,366 --> 00:04:53,233
it didn't cut back on

111
00:04:53,233 --> 00:04:54,766
previous redundant government spending. Instead, it

112
00:04:54,766 --> 00:04:56,199
chose to issue

113
00:05:04,766 --> 00:05:05,766
large amounts of debt, thinking that when oil prices rose, it would immediately recover. But this was clearly naive; it was just the beginning of a nightmare. To cope with high inflation,

114
00:05:05,766 --> 00:05:07,166
the US announced interest rate hikes, and

115
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:08,566
capital began to withdraw from the Latin American market. In

116
00:05:08,566 --> 00:05:10,633
1982, Mexico couldn't hold on any longer and

117
00:05:10,633 --> 00:05:12,166
announced it couldn't repay its foreign debt,

118
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:13,899
officially triggering the Latin American

119
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,266
debt crisis. Venezuela was also greatly affected. Venezuela couldn't hold on any longer.

120
00:05:37,466 --> 00:05:39,833
On February 18, 1983, the president announced that the bolivar's exchange rate had depreciated from 4.3 bolivars to 7.5 bolivars to the US dollar,

121
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:41,533
and foreign exchange controls were implemented. And, as you can imagine, a large portion of its capital was imported. This entire period is known as Venezuela's "Black Friday." Venezuela quickly plunged into an economic crisis, and

122
00:05:41,533 --> 00:05:42,933
oil prices further collapsed in 1986, falling from $27 to less than $10. What

123
00:05:57,566 --> 00:05:59,433
Venezuela didn't expect was that oil prices would remain at this low level for nearly 20 years. Inflation began to rise in Venezuela, and

124
00:06:03,566 --> 00:06:05,666
the government tried various policies, but none were effective. In fact, many of these policies were counterproductive,

125
00:06:10,933 --> 00:06:11,800
further pushing up prices in Venezuela. We'll analyze this in more detail when the situation worsens. The government realized that various control policies were ineffective, and in 1989, a new president named Perez was elected. He went to the other extreme, completely deregulating everything—

126
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,533
foreign exchange, interest

127
00:06:13,533 --> 00:06:14,933
rates,

128
00:06:14,933 --> 00:06:15,933
costs, and

129
00:06:15,933 --> 00:06:17,166
privatizing state-owned enterprises. This period is also known as the "Great Adjustment Period."

130
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:22,866
Those who frequently read our content should be familiar with

131
00:06:23,766 --> 00:06:24,866
this concept of extreme

132
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,800
market liberalization, which was extremely

133
00:06:40,899 --> 00:06:41,933
popular in the 1990s, mainly promoted by the United States. At that

134
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:45,299
time, it wasn't just in Latin America, but also in Southeast Asia, and later in Russia and Poland, shock therapy followed this style. It believed that the

135
00:06:46,233 --> 00:06:47,399
market would solve all problems. In fact, the liberalization

136
00:06:58,166 --> 00:07:00,366
reforms themselves weren't inherently problematic, but the issue was that these policies were too radical. Suddenly abandoning all

137
00:07:00,366 --> 00:07:01,466
control had a huge short-term impact on the

138
00:07:01,466 --> 00:07:03,233
economy.

139
00:07:03,233 --> 00:07:05,400
More importantly, this laissez-faire approach to market competition has a prerequisite: the market needs a basic business environment and a basic rule of law. But what was Venezuela's situation at the time? Market rules were nonexistent, many laws were ineffective, and public subsidies for food and energy were

140
00:07:06,633 --> 00:07:08,366
gone. The minimum wage was

141
00:07:23,466 --> 00:07:25,533
completely eliminated, which inevitably worsened the domestic economy, leading to numerous protests and riots. The bolivar began to plummet. As we just mentioned, on Black Friday in 1983, one dollar was worth

142
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,933
7.5 bolivars; by 1993, it had fallen to 1 dollar to 100 bolivars. In 1994,

143
00:07:36,466 --> 00:07:37,633
banks collapsed one after another, and corruption in the

144
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:48,799
government and financial sector was completely exposed. President Perez, for embezzling 250 million bolivars from the National Liberty Fund, became the first president to be impeached by the

145
00:07:52,366 --> 00:07:54,199
Supreme Court, and the Finance Minister was also forced to

146
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:55,266
resign. This also signaled the complete failure of the "Great Adjustment" era. As the tide receded, it became clear that almost everyone in the financial world was talking about it. This financial world may have glossed over many things, but

147
00:07:56,766 --> 00:07:58,566
I think its impact on the Venezuelan economy was more direct than the problems we just discussed. It was like a heavy punch to Venezuela's jaw, causing it to collapse on the

148
00:08:15,033 --> 00:08:15,733
spot. Speaking of which, I guess you can sense from our previous words that Venezuelan politics is quite chaotic. Just look at how frequently its name has

149
00:08:15,733 --> 00:08:17,433
changed. When it gained independence in 1830, it was called the States

150
00:08:17,433 --> 00:08:18,966
of Venezuela. Later, it was renamed the Republic of Venezuela. Less than 10 years later, seeing that the Americans to the north had a better system, they fought a war and changed the name to the United States of Venezuela. Then,

151
00:08:18,966 --> 00:08:20,266
after World War II, it was changed back to the

152
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,333
Republic of Venezuela. And then, you see, it has to be changed again. Although its

153
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:33,066
system has been basically democratic

154
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,933
elections, these elections are often invalid or heavily manipulated. There are also many different forces vying for power within the government. So, every president's position is precarious. They have to balance the interests of various interest groups, constantly worry about being overthrown or impeached, and find ways to attract votes. Of course, they also have to think about how to benefit themselves. This inevitably

155
00:08:42,966 --> 00:08:44,366
leads to many problems.

156
00:08:44,366 --> 00:08:45,799
But I believe that in the long run,

157
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:46,999
a very fundamental problem

158
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,566
is that its leadership is incapable of long-term investment and

159
00:08:49,566 --> 00:08:51,000
long-term planning. Let me

160
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,266
give you a simple example. Do you think the Venezuelan leader doesn't understand that

161
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,466
oil prices will continue to fluctuate and

162
00:08:56,466 --> 00:08:57,433
won't rise forever? The

163
00:08:57,433 --> 00:08:58,799
simplest way to prevent this is to establish

164
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,566
a national fund, like Norway, to save money

165
00:09:00,566 --> 00:09:01,733
when oil prices are high and

166
00:09:03,466 --> 00:09:04,399
buy gold or foreign bonds—making

167
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:05,466
long-term investments. Is that

168
00:09:05,466 --> 00:09:06,366
so difficult? Didn't the

169
00:09:06,366 --> 00:09:08,266
Venezuelan government think of this?

170
00:09:08,299 --> 00:09:09,533
Actually, it's not that

171
00:09:09,533 --> 00:09:11,066
they haven't tried, but these presidents gradually realized that

172
00:09:11,066 --> 00:09:12,566
every time they tried to save money, it only

173
00:09:12,566 --> 00:09:15,633
became a cash cow for the next few presidents. The

174
00:09:15,633 --> 00:09:17,066
dramatic changes in power, coupled

175
00:09:17,066 --> 00:09:18,166
with rampant corruption, made

176
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:19,466
any long-term investment almost impossible. Note that I'm referring to

177
00:09:20,766 --> 00:09:22,433
long-term investment

178
00:09:22,433 --> 00:09:24,166
not only in the form of

179
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:33,266
investments with

180
00:09:43,966 --> 00:09:45,833
returns, but also in institutional investments, such as investments in... The idea that a quick and effective presidential election can win over public support is a good analogy. From

181
00:09:49,266 --> 00:09:50,799
this

182
00:09:53,133 --> 00:09:54,866
perspective, look at Middle Eastern countries like Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE –

183
00:09:57,133 --> 00:09:59,133
these are relatively centralized monarchies. While they have many problems stemming from their strong power, they can indeed take a longer-term view and make many long-term investments. After all, this isn't just for the country, but also for their own future and their descendants. Look at their visionary plans, right?

184
00:10:10,133 --> 00:10:11,366
They might even be a bit too willing to

185
00:10:11,366 --> 00:10:13,433
invest long-term. In short, Venezuelan politics is quite chaotic. Let's go back to the

186
00:10:14,133 --> 00:10:15,266
timeline. In the 1980s and 1990s, with low oil prices, Venezuela's GDP didn't grow for 15 years. The economy stagnated, struggling in a high-inflation environment. The

187
00:10:17,866 --> 00:10:20,066
people increasingly hoped for a major reform. Against this historical

188
00:10:24,733 --> 00:10:26,333
backdrop, in 1999, Venezuela's most famous president, and also its most controversial leader, came to power: Hugo Chávez. Chávez himself had a military background and

189
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:27,433
a very strong-arm government.

190
00:10:35,433 --> 00:10:36,833
His advocacy of "socialism" led to the founding of the "United Socialist Party of Venezuela." He was very close to Cuba and had a very close relationship with Castro. Several

191
00:10:39,533 --> 00:10:41,566
times, he flew to Cuba to celebrate Castro's birthday with him for several days. In fact,

192
00:11:00,233 --> 00:11:02,266
Chavez had attempted to overthrow the existing regime in 1992, though unsuccessfully, but he gained significant public support. Later, in the

193
00:11:02,266 --> 00:11:04,066
1997 election, he advocated for

194
00:11:15,566 --> 00:11:17,366
large-scale reforms to address the status quo and eliminate corruption.

195
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:19,566
Imagine, the people, utterly disillusioned with the corrupt government, certainly hoped for a strong leader to change the situation. Thus, Chavez came to power forcefully and remained president of Venezuela until his death from cancer in 2013. And what did Chavez do first upon taking office? He changed the country's name to the "Bolivarian Revolution." You see, they seem to really like "

196
00:11:31,433 --> 00:11:33,133
Bolivarian," right? It's the country's name, and even the currency. The Bolivar is actually a name associated with a great general who helped South America gain independence from Spanish rule in the 19th century. Therefore, it carries a certain symbolic weight of independence, chaos, and patriotism. Chavez

197
00:11:37,933 --> 00:11:39,233
believed that the main reason Venezuela was previously in such chaos was the erosion of capitalism. They're trying to turn the wealth we've gained from our oil resources into their own profits.

198
00:11:39,233 --> 00:11:40,266
Inflation?

199
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:42,233
This isn't a

200
00:11:58,166 --> 00:12:00,033
natural economic phenomenon! This is the evil of capitalism! Hostile forces are behind this! This is their conspiracy! So he drastically implemented a series of public ownership reforms. All the key industries, like banking, infrastructure, transportation, electricity, and

201
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,733
communications, were nationalized, while taxes on foreign companies were increased. This scared away most foreign investment. In 2001, he passed the Land Law, allowing the state to expropriate land and encouraging grassroots communities to establish small cooperatives, providing them with funding and technical support

202
00:12:04,733 --> 00:12:06,366
as an alternative to a market economy. Chavez also

203
00:12:08,299 --> 00:12:10,099
successfully brought the previously independent central bank under

204
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,899
complete government control through several legislations. The

205
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:12,933
government had the final

206
00:12:12,933 --> 00:12:13,866
say.

207
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:16,233
This actually foreshadowed his later run into hyperinflation. And of all

208
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:20,366
Chavez's

209
00:12:34,533 --> 00:12:36,633
nationalization efforts, the most important one I haven't mentioned yet is oil. Are you wondering why? Didn't we just say that the oil industry was already nationalized in 1976 and had

210
00:12:36,633 --> 00:12:38,433
considerable influence,

211
00:12:38,433 --> 00:12:39,266
even being called a

212
00:12:39,266 --> 00:12:40,633
"state within a state"?

213
00:12:40,899 --> 00:12:41,899
Chávez felt it was a disgrace that

214
00:12:41,899 --> 00:12:43,766
the nation's lifeline, the

215
00:12:49,433 --> 00:12:51,266
oil company, was controlled by Americans and British, and that they had to share so much money with it. So, in 2002, he placed trusted individuals on the board of directors of the national oil company in an

216
00:12:51,266 --> 00:12:52,199
attempt to control him.

217
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,133
He appeared on a weekly television program

218
00:12:54,133 --> 00:12:55,766
called "

219
00:12:57,133 --> 00:12:58,499
April 7th," where he would

220
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,666
hold a whistle in his mouth and read out the

221
00:13:01,466 --> 00:13:02,700
names of the oil company executives who opposed him. Each

222
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,299
whistle signaled their dismissal.

223
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,066
This escalated,

224
00:13:10,066 --> 00:13:11,899
even leading to a brief military coup

225
00:13:11,899 --> 00:13:12,899
attempt to remove Chávez, which

226
00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:13,866
he suppressed. At the end of

227
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:14,833
2002,

228
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:16,333
employees of Venezuela's national oil company

229
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:17,566
staged a massive strike,

230
00:13:17,566 --> 00:13:19,200
virtually halting oil production. Output plummeted

231
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,600
from 3 million barrels

232
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,000
per day to less than 300,000 barrels per day,

233
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,733
essentially

234
00:13:22,733 --> 00:13:24,600
shutting down the country's engine.

235
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,200
This strike,

236
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,000
conservatively estimated, cost

237
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,466
Venezuela $10 billion in economic losses,

238
00:13:28,466 --> 00:13:30,700
causing a 27% decline in its GDP in the first quarter of 2003.

239
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,766
However, these short-term economic losses were relatively minor. Even

240
00:13:33,766 --> 00:13:35,766
more devastating was the long-term damage it caused.

241
00:13:35,766 --> 00:13:37,333
Chavez's response was extremely harsh: "

242
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:38,366
You're on strike? You're

243
00:13:38,366 --> 00:13:39,299
not working?

244
00:13:39,299 --> 00:13:40,466
Then you don't need to come anymore. Fire

245
00:13:49,966 --> 00:13:51,200
everyone!" This resulted in the dismissal of nearly 20,000 employees. You might not think that many now, but for the Venezuelan state-owned oil company at the time, it meant almost half its workforce was laid off. And think about it, this was different from typical layoffs. Normally, layoffs are selective, choosing those who are

246
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:53,899
easy to lay

247
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:56,033
off. But back then, they targeted those who took to the streets. No matter who

248
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,799
you were, if you

249
00:13:57,799 --> 00:13:58,999
held key technologies or

250
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,099
held a critical position,

251
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,000
if you took to

252
00:14:14,366 --> 00:14:15,366
the streets, you were out. This resulted in the layoff of many core

253
00:14:15,366 --> 00:14:17,299
technical personnel. After this upheaval, Chavez did indeed successfully control the state-owned oil company, but he paid a very heavy price. Not only did external technology withdraw, but he also laid off a large portion of his technical staff, causing Venezuela's oil technology to regress by more than a decade. Both management and technical capabilities have

254
00:14:17,299 --> 00:14:18,199
declined drastically.

255
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,099
With aging equipment and

256
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:20,966
technology loss, more than

257
00:14:20,966 --> 00:14:22,299
20 years later,

258
00:14:22,299 --> 00:14:23,199
its extraction capacity is less than

259
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,100
half of its peak before the strike.

260
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,399
The oil was simply left there for you to extract. It just ca

261
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:29,433
n't get anything out. After only a couple of digs, it starts panting and

262
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,633
can't keep up, so it has to sit and rest for half a day. And many American oil giants, including ExxonMobil, either had their assets forcibly seized or were forced to accept new contracts in the period that followed.

263
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,500
You see, the

264
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,166
vast area of ​​refineries in the Gulf of Mexico is designed for

265
00:14:52,733 --> 00:14:54,566
Venezuelan heavy oil. This disruption is

266
00:14:57,399 --> 00:14:58,499
n't just about losing a few barrels of oil in the short term; it means these newly invested refineries will face a "famine" for decades. They won't have oil to refine and will have to rely on Canadian heavy

267
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:03,300
oil as a substitute. So, as we analyzed before, this US attack on Venezuela definitely has a significant reason: it's not just because of its abundance of oil, but because it's all heavy oil suitable for US refineries. The situation is starting to get complicated.

268
00:15:06,933 --> 00:15:07,999
Let's

269
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,399
lay out some

270
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:09,833
background information.

271
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:11,566
Oil-rich countries like Venezuela are

272
00:15:11,566 --> 00:15:13,899
hard-pressed to

273
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:30,333
escape this so-called "oil curse." It's not simply a matter of money leading to corruption.

274
00:15:31,633 --> 00:15:33,366
You see, having abundant natural resources leads to exports, generating large amounts of US dollars. And then...

275
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,333
It converts large amounts of US dollars into the local

276
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:38,200
bolivar, leading to a continuous appreciation of the bolivar. When your currency appreciates, your domestically produced goods become more expensive for other countries, losing competitiveness. Goods from other countries become cheaper, leading you to favor goods from other nations. This significantly weakens Venezuela's domestic agriculture and manufacturing,

277
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,933
causing them to gradually decline.

278
00:15:41,233 --> 00:15:42,166
So, over time,

279
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:43,799
from a national perspective, its economic model

280
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:45,233
becomes

281
00:15:45,233 --> 00:15:46,133
frantically exporting oil

282
00:15:46,133 --> 00:15:47,033
and buying other goods.

283
00:15:47,033 --> 00:15:48,433
You see,

284
00:15:48,433 --> 00:15:49,833
over 95% of its exports are oil, while

285
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:53,200
over 80% of its domestic industry and food

286
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:53,799
are imported.

287
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:55,833
Its domestic manufacturing and agriculture decline, and the service

288
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:57,233
sector becomes the main industry.

289
00:15:57,233 --> 00:15:58,500
It's like a rich kid who,

290
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,399
because God has given them so much, ca

291
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:01,599
n't help but become decadent.

292
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,700
This phenomenon has a specific term in economics:

293
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:04,733
"Dutch disease," named after a similar phenomenon that occurred

294
00:16:04,733 --> 00:16:06,533
in the Netherlands in the 1960s.

295
00:16:07,966 --> 00:16:09,399
However, I think it should actually be called "

296
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:10,033
Dutch disease.

297
00:16:11,433 --> 00:16:12,966
" If this so-called disease

298
00:16:12,966 --> 00:16:14,633
continues indefinitely, it

299
00:16:14,633 --> 00:16:15,699
's not a big problem;

300
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:16,966
I'll just keep selling oil to make money

301
00:16:16,966 --> 00:16:18,000
and buying other things. The

302
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,799
key issue is that

303
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:20,366
this country's industrial capacity has deteriorated, and it

304
00:16:20,366 --> 00:16:21,700
can't produce anything of its own.

305
00:16:25,533 --> 00:16:26,799
This means its economy has lost its immunity; any slight disturbance could cause it to collapse. This is why, in the 1980s, when

306
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:27,599
oil prices fell,

307
00:16:40,233 --> 00:16:42,366
Venezuelan oil companies might seem to think, "So what if oil prices fall? You'll just earn less, it won't cause a collapse." The reason is that its non-oil sectors had lost their capacity and completely deteriorated. And the crux of all this is the exchange rate. Look at how Chavez messed with the oil companies;

308
00:16:42,366 --> 00:16:43,799
foreign investors

309
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:44,699
avoided the country like the plague, and

310
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,200
domestic citizens lost confidence

311
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,033
in the

312
00:16:47,033 --> 00:16:48,566
economy and went abroad to

313
00:16:48,566 --> 00:16:50,500
exchange their money for US dollars.

314
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,633
This led to a

315
00:16:52,633 --> 00:16:53,599
continuous decline in the exchange rate of its currency, the bolivar, and a continuous

316
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,766
rise in prices.

317
00:16:54,766 --> 00:16:56,733
Faced with these two classic economic difficulties, Chavez's

318
00:16:56,733 --> 00:16:57,833
response was

319
00:16:57,833 --> 00:16:59,033
very simple and brutal: "The

320
00:16:59,033 --> 00:17:00,333
exchange rate is falling?

321
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:00,966
No way!

322
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,500
I'll

323
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,099
set an official exchange rate.

324
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,733
Prices are rising? No way! I'll set a cap on the purchasing power of the bolivar." But the cost was further degradation of domestic productivity, further distortion of the economic structure, and further growth of corruption and the black market. With further capital flight and increased shortages of supplies, Venezuela was terminally ill. However, things didn't deteriorate rapidly; instead, life in Venezuela gradually improved. Why? Because oil prices rebounded,

325
00:17:32,733 --> 00:17:34,500
and moreover, at the beginning

326
00:17:40,133 --> 00:17:42,033
of the year, the

327
00:17:44,899 --> 00:17:47,499
global economy experienced a surge, leading to a dramatic increase in oil demand. Oil prices increased sixfold in

328
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,966
seven years, and Venezuela's goldmine returned. With

329
00:17:50,633 --> 00:17:52,133
this influx of abundant US dollars, the entire economy returned to the prosperous state it had been in the 1970s. Instead of using this respite to build a reserve fund, Chavez heavily subsidized the public, providing them with almost free electricity, almost free

330
00:17:52,133 --> 00:17:53,166
water, and almost free oil. Very cheap food and generous housing subsidies. He also established thousands of

331
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:55,099
free medical clinics for the poor. At the time, gasoline in Venezuela was even cheaper than bottled water. $100 worth of gasoline was enough to drive around the world several times over. The government became increasingly large and bloated. About a quarter of Venezuela's working population worked in government. Although the economic structure was unbalanced and basic necessities had to be imported, it didn't matter, because

332
00:17:56,933 --> 00:17:57,799
oil prices were rising

333
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,333
and

334
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:02,200
people had more money. People's lives improved under Chavez's leadership. The country's GDP quadrupled in just ten years. Venezuela was gradually eliminating poverty, and its

335
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,366
urbanization rate reached

336
00:18:09,033 --> 00:18:10,233
90%, the highest in South America. At this

337
00:18:23,566 --> 00:18:25,399
rate, it could soon become

338
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:27,399
one of the world's richest countries again. To encourage borrowing, Chavez even set a cap on interest rates. The idea was to borrow more, spend more, invest more, and not save. The highest interest rate for credit cards at the time was 29%. This might sound very high, but you have to know that

339
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:31,299
Venezuela's

340
00:18:31,299 --> 00:18:32,766
inflation rate at the time was 30%-50%. Its

341
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,633
loan interest rates are lower than the inflation rate; the real

342
00:18:40,633 --> 00:18:42,633
interest rate has always been negative. After you

343
00:18:42,633 --> 00:18:43,899
borrow money, the

344
00:18:43,899 --> 00:18:44,533
amount you actually have to repay decreases, so saving money results in increasingly lower returns. Naturally, everyone borrows money instead of saving. This led to a consumer frenzy in

345
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:53,600
Venezuela, where people bought cars without hesitation, all for the sake of financial management. The

346
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,799
real estate bubble was even more pronounced. This negative real interest rate caused the entire economy to accelerate rapidly, with capital turnover becoming faster and faster. A very interesting consumer trend emerged: cosmetic surgery.

347
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:11,799
Venezuela became

348
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,299
one of the countries in the Americas most fond of cosmetic surgery. Many women considered

349
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:20,933
it an essential step in their coming-of-age ceremony. Families with the means would prepare money for their daughters' cosmetic surgery. Now, there's a social consensus that cosmetic surgery is a "necessary path" to better career opportunities and higher social status. After all, with such high inflation,

350
00:19:20,933 --> 00:19:22,966
saving

351
00:19:22,966 --> 00:19:24,299
money is impossible, but cosmetic surgery is a long-term

352
00:19:26,466 --> 00:19:28,700
investment in one's life. You should know that Venezuela is a global beauty pageant powerhouse, arguably the

353
00:19:29,933 --> 00:19:32,399
strongest in the world. It has won the most titles in the four major

354
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:45,433
global beauty pageants. Venezuela, also known as the "Land of Beauties," has a very complete beauty pageant system. Not only does it have the highest-level "Miss Venezuela" pageant, but every city, community, and even school has its own

355
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:55,200
beauty pageant, forming a

356
00:20:03,133 --> 00:20:05,233
complete beauty selection mechanism. Naturally, this has also led to the rise of a related industry chain: beauty pageant training and cosmetic surgery. Okay, let's lighten things up a bit. Now back to the main topic. In 2013, Chávez died of cancer. During his 14 years in power, oil prices initially rose steadily and then fluctuated at high levels. He used the wealth generated by oil to directly improve the lives of Venezuelans. However,

357
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,666
some fundamental economic problems, such as structural issues, corruption, and government inefficiency, continued to worsen under the nourishment of the oil boom. His successor,

358
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:26,699
Nicolás Maduro, also from the United Socialist Party, was not so lucky. Almost as soon as

359
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,100
he took office, before he even had a chance to settle in, oil

360
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,733
prices began to plummet. Venezuela's good days are over. The crisis of the 1980s is essentially repeating itself, only this time with even greater intensity. Its

361
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,466
economic structure and

362
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:39,433
inefficient

363
00:20:39,433 --> 00:20:40,599
state-owned enterprises simply cannot support domestic demand. Most necessities rely on imports, a constant stream of overseas purchases. But with

364
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,500
oil

365
00:20:52,233 --> 00:20:53,666
prices falling, Venezuela has run out of money and can no longer afford these

366
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:55,099
goods. In five years, Venezuela's imports have plummeted to one-sixth of previous levels, plunging the country into severe

367
00:20:56,733 --> 00:20:58,133
shortages. By 2015, due to severe shortages and

368
00:21:02,433 --> 00:21:03,933
government price controls to prevent price increases,

369
00:21:03,933 --> 00:21:05,533
many food items, including toilet paper, were snapped up as soon as they hit the shelves. Many cities had to be fenced off with iron bars, and armed security personnel had to patrol

370
00:21:05,533 --> 00:21:06,666
supermarkets to prevent excessive riots or "zero-dollar purchases." You'd think there were some treasures inside! Eventually, the

371
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,133
lines in front of supermarkets

372
00:21:12,433 --> 00:21:14,066
became so long and chaotic that

373
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,899
the government mandated that people go to the supermarket on a per-item

374
00:21:20,733 --> 00:21:22,799
basis. For example, those with birthdates ending in 0 or 1 could go on Mondays, and those with birthdates ending in 2 or 3 on Tuesdays. And so on.

375
00:21:27,233 --> 00:21:28,533
To prevent people from potentially stealing others' identities, he also installed fingerprint recognition machines at

376
00:21:32,066 --> 00:21:33,566
supermarket entrances. During the peak of the shortage in 2017, many people survived by scavenging food from garbage. Out of humanitarian considerations, Colombia

377
00:21:33,566 --> 00:21:34,933
opened its borders to Venezuelans, providing them with some supplies and food. But even with such a shortage of supplies and soaring prices, there was one thing that Venezuela had always kept very cheap, even the cheapest in the

378
00:21:38,399 --> 00:21:39,933
world: gasoline. Note that it's not oil, but gasoline for cars. Why? It's not that

379
00:21:55,299 --> 00:21:56,666
Venezuela has low oil production costs. As we just mentioned, its equipment is outdated, it lacks skilled workers, and it has almost no capacity to refine gasoline. It has to import all its gasoline. The reason it's so cheap is because the government has continuously invested heavily in subsidies, making it practically free. You can fill up your tank for just one dollar. But there's no such thing as a free lunch. Gasoline is

380
00:22:11,933 --> 00:22:12,999
practically free, so everyone rushes to fill up. The cost is transformed from money into waiting time. So many people just sit there waiting in line every day. Let me tell you, if you go to Venezuela—but I do

381
00:22:26,233 --> 00:22:28,399
n't recommend it—you'll see a long line of cars on the roadside, queuing up all day long, almost without moving. This isn't just traffic; they're queuing for

382
00:22:29,433 --> 00:22:30,533
gas. Even in Caracas, the capital, the

383
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:34,233
wait is relatively short, averaging 5-6 hours. In many places, the wait can be several days, even a week. People basically sit in their cars queuing during the day, then lock their cars and go home to sleep when the gas stations close at night,

384
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:41,700
only to return the next day to queue again. Of course, there are market-

385
00:22:51,933 --> 00:22:53,133
based gas stations that charge international fuel prices, so there aren't queues there. But most Venezuelans have become accustomed to this free gasoline, so they still queue. Think about it, this isn't just a single gas

386
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,899
station or a few cities; it's a nationwide phenomenon. What a huge waste of resources! Queues at supermarkets, queues at gas stations—

387
00:23:00,633 --> 00:23:01,933
countless people are queuing every moment across the country. And what's even more problematic is that such a large subsidy leads to smuggling. Many people smuggle

388
00:23:01,933 --> 00:23:03,866
this cheap gasoline to neighboring Brazil or Colombia to sell. It's estimated that the value exceeds $10 billion

389
00:23:06,066 --> 00:23:07,699


390
00:23:14,033 --> 00:23:16,599
annually, exacerbating the already severe gasoline shortage. Hearing this, you might be thinking, "When fuel prices were high, the government had so much money it was overflowing, so you wanted to subsidize it. That's understandable. But now the economy is like this..." With

391
00:23:19,033 --> 00:23:20,099
such a severe government fiscal deficit, why bother with subsidies? Just stop subsidizing!

392
00:23:34,733 --> 00:23:35,933
The Maduro government isn't unwilling, it's afraid. People have become accustomed to this near-free gasoline. If you liberalize it, the price could increase hundreds or thousands of times, triggering strong public discontent, anger, and

393
00:23:35,933 --> 00:23:36,799
protests. The Maduro

394
00:23:38,733 --> 00:23:40,266
regime is already unstable, so they have no choice but to continue subsidies. But the increased discontent is a problem, and now there's another layer of pressure: US

395
00:23:53,866 --> 00:23:56,799
sanctions. Since 2006, the US has imposed limited sanctions on some Venezuelan individuals, including Chavez himself. Starting in 2014, the US stated that the Venezuelan

396
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:58,266
government had human rights abuses, undermined democracy, manipulated elections, etc., and

397
00:23:58,266 --> 00:24:00,599
therefore imposed increased sanctions. Gradually, the sanctions evolved from targeting

398
00:24:07,899 --> 00:24:09,866
individuals to sanctioning the entire country. Especially after Trump took office in his first term, he refused to recognize Maduro as president or the regime. The US, along with dozens of other countries,

399
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:12,200
imposed very strong and comprehensive economic sanctions on Venezuela. The biggest blows

400
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,866
came from sanctions on the oil industry and financing transactions, freezing the assets of the national oil company, prohibiting the US from buying its oil, and restricting the Venezuelan government. All

401
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,233
financing activities of oil companies were affected. Sanctions on the oil industry prevented the Venezuelan government from earning money, and restrictions on

402
00:24:33,666 --> 00:24:36,133
financing

403
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:38,999
prevented them from borrowing. In short, Venezuela was deprived of funds. On one hand, there were US sanctions; on the other hand, its extraction capacity had severely declined after the major strike. As a result, Venezuelan oil production plummeted by 90% after 2015. At this time,

404
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,399
Venezuela's government debt was increasing, and the deficit was growing larger. In 2017, the

405
00:24:43,633 --> 00:24:44,933
government selectively defaulted on its foreign debt. Maduro had to activate his backup plan, the last thing economists wanted to see:

406
00:24:45,833 --> 00:24:47,000
he started printing money. We've discussed before how

407
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,633

Zimbabwe's currency

408
00:24:55,633 --> 00:24:57,133
depreciated too quickly, adding

409
00:24:58,666 --> 00:24:59,899


410
00:24:59,899 --> 00:25:01,299
zeros too rapidly, forcing the continuous introduction of new currencies. Venezuela was similar. Its previous currency was called the Bolivar. Due to severe depreciation, in 2008, three zeros were removed, and a new currency called the

411
00:25:02,133 --> 00:25:03,833
"Strong Bolivar" was

412
00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:09,833
introduced. It was said that 1 Strong

413
00:25:13,666 --> 00:25:14,566
Bolivar = 1000 Bolivars. Initially, one US dollar was equal to 2.15 bolivars. Later, it gradually depreciated to 10 bolivars per dollar. You might think this

414
00:25:14,566 --> 00:25:16,100
rate of depreciation is acceptable, but let me tell you, this is just the official exchange rate. The black market rate had already reached

415
00:25:28,433 --> 00:25:30,966
10,000 bolivars per dollar. Because the black market was so rampant, the official exchange rate had to follow suit, falling to 4 million bolivars per dollar by August 2018. What to do? They rounded down five zeros and introduced a new currency unit called the "Sovereign Bolivar," with one

416
00:25:30,966 --> 00:25:33,233
Sovereign Bolivar equal to 100,000 bolivars. By 2019, Venezuela's

417
00:25:37,033 --> 00:25:38,666
inflation

418
00:25:41,033 --> 00:25:43,466
had exceeded 300,000%, meaning 30,000 yuan today would be equivalent to one yuan next year. So in 2020, they introduced a new currency called the "Digital Bolivar," rounding down six zeros from the Sovereign Bolivar. Does

419
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,599
n't that sound like a tongue twister? The current exchange rate is approximately

420
00:25:47,666 --> 00:25:50,833
325 digital bolivars per dollar. If we use 2000... The original version of the bolivar, if you add

421
00:25:51,433 --> 00:25:52,566
14 zeros after the

422
00:25:59,833 --> 00:26:00,600
325, becomes 3.25 trillion bolivars. You don't need much economic knowledge to imagine that when prices rise to this level, the

423
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,600
economy is essentially paralyzed. Everyone's money is burning their hands; they just want to spend it as quickly as possible. You

424
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:11,933
don't care about price; you buy toilet paper whenever you see it, hoarding it if you can. Forget about investment and production. Historically, once a country falls into this vortex of hyperinflation, it's very difficult to stop or escape. But look at Venezuela's hyperinflation; it miraculously came down in

425
00:26:14,966 --> 00:26:15,866
2020. Why? I'll tell you, it's not miraculous at all. Venezuelans completely abandoned their own currency. Strong bolivar, sovereign bolivar—even if you gave me a

426
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:20,399
"super invincible bolivar," I would

427
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,599
n't

428
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,299
believe it. The entire country began using the US dollar for transactions on a large

429
00:26:26,299 --> 00:26:27,999
scale, becoming dollarized. Now, when you

430
00:26:31,399 --> 00:26:32,299
walk into a restaurant, a roadside stall, or a supermarket, most prices are in US dollars. The numerical bolivar

431
00:26:41,666 --> 00:26:43,233
hardly circulates at all. And you should know that the US dollar is not even the official currency in Venezuela. Therefore,

432
00:26:43,366 --> 00:26:45,166
US dollar bills are extremely rare; you simply can't withdraw them from ATMs, especially small change. This leads to a rather amusing phenomenon: for example, if you go to a restaurant and spend $13,

433
00:26:56,366 --> 00:26:57,166
don't expect the

434
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,399
restaurant to give you the two dollars in change. You just order a few more things to make it $15, and everyone's happy. So now, US dollar payment apps like Zelle and PayPal are very common in Venezuela. In other words, a large number of transactions in

435
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:06,833
Venezuela are actually

436
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:08,266
completed between US banks.

437
00:27:08,266 --> 00:27:08,866
You see, the Venezuelan

438
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,166
banks and government are

439
00:27:12,166 --> 00:27:12,899
quite helpless. In the last decade, over 8 million people have fled Venezuela—more than a quarter of its population. They all left in just a few years, including many talented people, wealthy individuals, and students. Everyone who could leave did. Originally, the problems of corruption and economic structure were

440
00:27:12,899 --> 00:27:14,499
n't entirely unsolvable,

441
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,433
but

442
00:27:26,466 --> 00:27:28,700
now that people are gone, it's an irreversible loss. The long-term impact

443
00:27:30,233 --> 00:27:31,500
on Venezuela is devastating. Many people earn less than $10 a month, which is simply not enough to make ends meet. Most of them rely on relatives abroad. Sending money to make a living:

444
00:27:32,066 --> 00:27:33,799
Many of these people are

445
00:27:43,799 --> 00:27:45,433
descendants of people who immigrated to Venezuela in the 1950s and 60s, full of hope. Who knew that after so many

446
00:27:45,433 --> 00:27:46,499
years of ups and downs, their

447
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:49,533
children would now be forced to flee the country? This wave of immigration has also led to hundreds of thousands of

448
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,533
Venezuelan immigrants being accepted by South American countries like Colombia, Brazil, Peru, and Argentina in the past two years. This has indeed taken away many jobs in the short term, causing considerable instability throughout South America. Therefore, this wave of immigration

449
00:28:00,533 --> 00:28:01,733
can be considered one of the most significant crises South America has faced recently. In 2020, the country's GDP fell to

450
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,933
only 15% of what it was ten years ago, even lower than the level

451
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:15,700
in 1980. However, after our analysis,

452
00:28:17,866 --> 00:28:18,899
you can probably see that the high GDP a decade ago didn't mean the economy was booming. The recent economic collapse isn't just a problem of the last ten years, nor is it solely the fault of the Maduro-Chávez government; it's a concentrated eruption of

453
00:28:18,899 --> 00:28:20,499
various deep-seated problems accumulated

454
00:28:32,266 --> 00:28:34,399
over the past century. In fact, if you look at Venezuelan urban development, it's not like many African countries where people are simply

455
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:36,133
poor; you

456
00:28:36,899 --> 00:28:38,799
can see that it was wealthy before. But in the last

457
00:28:48,899 --> 00:28:50,433
10 years, the government has indeed run out of money. Basically, the management of public order and public welfare is in a semi-hands-off, semi-laissez-faire state. The overall public security is very bad. So, starting a few years ago, many countries' officials advised their citizens not to travel to Venezuela because it's dangerous. There's an area called

458
00:29:03,733 --> 00:29:05,799
Petare in the Venezuelan capital. You see the walls painted in beautiful, colorful colors, but in reality, it's one of the largest slums in

459
00:29:05,799 --> 00:29:07,999
Latin America, housing over 2 million people. The houses on several hills are extremely densely packed, one next to another. There isn't

460
00:29:11,799 --> 00:29:13,333
even a stable supply of water, electricity, or sewage systems. It looks peaceful during the day because everyone is either sleeping or working in the city. But at night, it becomes a haven for gangsters and one of the regions with the highest crime and murder rates in the world. I think even the most daring social media

461
00:29:19,899 --> 00:29:20,799
bloggers would need several experienced guides,

462
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,266
travel in groups, and stay in their cars before daring to go there. And even after

463
00:29:26,533 --> 00:29:28,033
you leave

464
00:29:29,333 --> 00:29:31,466
this slum, the security situation in the capital, Caracas, isn't very good either. If you're not careful and wander around in places you shouldn't be, Oops, you'll be broke. If you're

465
00:29:42,899 --> 00:29:43,933
driving in its capital... You'll find that at

466
00:29:43,933 --> 00:29:44,633
night, the traffic lights are basically just for show; nobody cares. Everyone just

467
00:29:55,066 --> 00:29:56,899
runs across the red light. Why? It's not that everyone

468
00:29:58,733 --> 00:29:59,799
in Venezuela is a thug or wants to break the law. It's mainly because the security situation there is so

469
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:01,133
bad. A couple of years ago, there was a shooting incident where people were moving forward to turn off the

470
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:09,933
light. People were too afraid to even look at the train until it disappeared from view. When the light turned off,

471
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:10,666
people just ignored it.

472
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,666
The whole city, the whole country, is basically in a state of complete traffic freedom. Take the subway, for example. At first glance, it seems much better than the New York subway. It was

473
00:30:18,466 --> 00:30:20,500
built in the early 2000s when Venezuela was particularly wealthy. But now, the government has neither the ability nor the resources to operate the subway. The entire Caracas subway is free. It does

474
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,899
n't have

475
00:30:29,399 --> 00:30:31,933
automatic ticket checking; it's all about skill. If you can squeeze on, you sit down. There's no air conditioning.

476
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,866
Venezuela relies on hydroelectric power stations

477
00:30:37,899 --> 00:30:39,199
built more than half a century ago to support the electricity needs of the entire nation. However, due to a lack of

478
00:30:39,866 --> 00:30:41,033
talent, poor maintenance, and a

479
00:30:41,033 --> 00:30:42,533
lack of alternative energy

480
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,733
sources... Power outages occur almost every two or three days, especially in 2019 when a

481
00:30:57,733 --> 00:30:59,600
nationwide mega-scale blackout lasted for a week, costing over $

482
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,500
10 billion. More than $100 million was discovered during a congressional investigation, and over 14 thermal power plants were found to be inoperable. You can imagine the extent of corruption involved. Having made so many videos analyzing national economies, I've

483
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,633
found that you can't just look at

484
00:31:13,633 --> 00:31:15,533
research reports and economic data. If we only focus on economic analysis, we might develop some misconceptions about the

485
00:31:21,399 --> 00:31:23,266
lives of people in that country. Actually,

486
00:31:23,899 --> 00:31:25,833
you can look at videos of people living their lives at that time, from the perspective of happiness indexes and their expressed emotions. It might not be as dire or unfortunate as people imagine based on

487
00:31:25,833 --> 00:31:26,533
economic data. The many

488
00:31:26,533 --> 00:31:28,866
economic problems we just mentioned do exist; Venezuela

489
00:31:29,466 --> 00:31:31,200
's economy is indeed a

490
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,066
mess. But South Americans are incredibly

491
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,433
optimistic, easygoing, and know how to enjoy life. They complain about wages, the capital, and the

492
00:31:51,233 --> 00:31:53,100
government in a chaotic manner, and their communication rate is high. However, it's not that everyone is tense and afraid

493
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:55,866
to go out. Everyone

494
00:31:55,866 --> 00:31:56,933
should just go about their business,

495
00:31:56,933 --> 00:31:57,666
work or go to school. If you see a gang doing business somewhere, just avoid it. Don't stop at

496
00:32:09,233 --> 00:32:10,899
red lights. In recent years, with Venezuela's complete dollar-backed economy, the inflation problem has gradually improved. The extreme economic phenomenon has forced Venezuela to abandon its "economic package" approach. Supermarket shelves are overflowing, but market prices mean Venezuelan goods are more expensive than those in Miami. Real wages are still lower than

497
00:32:21,666 --> 00:32:22,299
50 years ago. Gangs demand protection money, and police frequently collect "tolls." The whole country has fallen into a jungle law mentality, somewhat like a semi-anarchy.

498
00:32:22,299 --> 00:32:24,299
After Maduro's arrest, the US is likely more focused on

499
00:32:25,633 --> 00:32:27,433
Venezuela's oil and economic stability, and less likely on developing its overall economy. Its

500
00:32:27,433 --> 00:32:28,099
overall economic structure is

501
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:30,033
essentially in

502
00:32:30,033 --> 00:32:30,866
shock therapy. An

503
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,266
economy that failed to utilize its oil resources when it was resource-rich and had sufficient income is a prime example of this. Instead, it fostered government corruption, allowed domestic productivity to decline, and exacerbated economic imbalances. Meanwhile, government policies such as price

504
00:32:37,266 --> 00:32:38,399
controls,

505
00:32:39,933 --> 00:32:41,466
foreign exchange controls, and interest

506
00:32:43,933 --> 00:32:45,433
rate controls were like drinking poison to quench thirst, leading to hyperinflation. It's like a child who isn't fully mature; they make mistakes. But if they start with astronomical wealth, the corrective mechanism is

507
00:32:54,333 --> 00:32:56,066
likely to fail. Small economic imbalances, minor corruption, and small price distortions,

508
00:33:10,333 --> 00:33:11,600
without timely feedback in an environment of continuous wealth inflow, will stray further and further from the right path. By the time they are critically ill, a sudden drop in oil prices will

509
00:33:21,133 --> 00:33:22,400
trigger a vicious cycle, making it difficult to recover. Therefore, sometimes having

510
00:33:26,666 --> 00:33:27,599
too much money and spending it in the wrong places can be more

511
00:33:29,266 --> 00:33:31,599
fatal than

512
00:33:33,899 --> 00:33:36,266
having no money at all. As the former Venezuelan Energy Minister, also known as the father of OPEC,

513
00:34:02,866 --> 00:34:04,500
said,

514
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,333
oil will bring us destruction;

515
00:34:06,333 --> 00:34:08,033
it is the devil's excrement,

516
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,733
perhaps a kind of

517
00:34:09,733 --> 00:34:11,533
Venezuelan excrement.
